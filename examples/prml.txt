Preface

Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew
out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of
the same ﬁeld, and together they have undergone substantial development over the
past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to
become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework
for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of
Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of
approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa-
gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had signiﬁcant impact on both
algorithms and applications.

This new textbook reﬂects these recent developments while providing a compre-
hensive introduction to the ﬁelds of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is
aimed at advanced undergraduates or ﬁrst year PhD students, as well as researchers
and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma-
chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra
is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not es-
sential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.
Because this book has broad scope, it is impossible to provide a complete list of
references, and in particular no attempt has been made to provide accurate historical
attribution of ideas. Instead, the aim has been to give references that offer greater
detail than is possible here and that hopefully provide entry points into what, in some
cases, is a very extensive literature. For this reason, the references are often to more
recent textbooks and review articles rather than to original sources.

The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, including lecture
slides as well as the complete set of ﬁgures used in the book, and the reader is
encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information:

PREFACE

Exercises
The exercises that appear at the end of every chapter form an important com-
ponent of the book. Each exercise has been carefully chosen to reinforce concepts
explained in the text or to develop and generalize them in signiﬁcant ways, and each
is graded according to difﬁculty ranging from ((cid:1)), which denotes a simple exercise
taking a few minutes to complete, through to ((cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1)), which denotes a signiﬁcantly
more complex exercise.

It has been difﬁcult to know to what extent these solutions should be made
widely available. Those engaged in self study will ﬁnd worked solutions very ben-
eﬁcial, whereas many course tutors request that solutions be available only via the
publisher so that the exercises may be used in class. In order to try to meet these
conﬂicting requirements, those exercises that help amplify key points in the text, or
that ﬁll in important details, have solutions that are available as a PDF ﬁle from the
book web site. Such exercises are denoted by www . Solutions for the remaining
exercises are available to course tutors by contacting the publisher (contact details
are given on the book web site). Readers are strongly encouraged to work through
the exercises unaided, and to turn to the solutions only as required.

Although this book focuses on concepts and principles, in a taught course the
students should ideally have the opportunity to experiment with some of the key
algorithms using appropriate data sets. A companion volume (Bishop and Nabney,
2008) will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning,
and will be accompanied by Matlab software implementing most of the algorithms
discussed in this book.

Acknowledgements
First of all I would like to express my sincere thanks to Markus Svens´en who
has provided immense help with preparation of ﬁgures and with the typesetting of
the book in LATEX. His assistance has been invaluable.

I am very grateful to Microsoft Research for providing a highly stimulating re-
search environment and for giving me the freedom to write this book (the views and
opinions expressed in this book, however, are my own and are therefore not neces-
sarily the same as those of Microsoft or its afﬁliates).

Springer has provided excellent support throughout the ﬁnal stages of prepara-
tion of this book, and I would like to thank my commissioning editor John Kimmel
for his support and professionalism, as well as Joseph Piliero for his help in design-
ing the cover and the text format and MaryAnn Brickner for her numerous contribu-
tions during the production phase. The inspiration for the cover design came from a
discussion with Antonio Criminisi.

I also wish to thank Oxford University Press for permission to reproduce ex-
cerpts from an earlier textbook, Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition (Bishop,
1995a). The images of the Mark 1 perceptron and of Frank Rosenblatt are repro-
duced with the permission of Arvin Calspan Advanced Technology Center. I would
also like to thank Asela Gunawardana for plotting the spectrogram in Figure 13.1,

Mathematical notation

I have tried to keep the mathematical content of the book to the minimum neces-
sary to achieve a proper understanding of the ﬁeld. However, this minimum level is
nonzero, and it should be emphasized that a good grasp of calculus, linear algebra,
and probability theory is essential for a clear understanding of modern pattern recog-
nition and machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, the emphasis in this book is
on conveying the underlying concepts rather than on mathematical rigour.

I have tried to use a consistent notation throughout the book, although at times
this means departing from some of the conventions used in the corresponding re-
search literature. Vectors are denoted by lower case bold Roman letters such as
x, and all vectors are assumed to be column vectors. A superscript T denotes the
transpose of a matrix or vector, so that xT will be a row vector. Uppercase bold
roman letters, such as M, denote matrices. The notation (w1, . . . , wM ) denotes a
row vector with M elements, while the corresponding column vector is written as
w = (w1, . . . , wM )T.

The notation [a, b] is used to denote the closed interval from a to b, that is the
interval including the values a and b themselves, while (a, b) denotes the correspond-
ing open interval, that is the interval excluding a and b. Similarly, [a, b) denotes an
interval that includes a but excludes b. For the most part, however, there will be
little need to dwell on such reﬁnements as whether the end points of an interval are
included or not.
The M × M identity matrix (also known as the unit matrix) is denoted IM ,
which will be abbreviated to I where there is no ambiguity about it dimensionality.
It has elements Iij that equal 1 if i = j and 0 if i (cid:2)= j.

functional is discussed in Appendix D.

A functional is denoted f[y] where y(x) is some function. The concept of a
The notation g(x) = O(f(x)) denotes that |f(x)/g(x)| is bounded as x → ∞.

For instance if g(x) = 3x2 + 2, then g(x) = O(x2).

The expectation of a function f(x, y) with respect to a random variable x is de-
noted by Ex[f(x, y)]. In situations where there is no ambiguity as to which variable
is being averaged over, this will be simpliﬁed by omitting the sufﬁx, for instance

MATHEMATICAL NOTATION

E[x]. If the distribution of x is conditioned on another variable z, then the corre-
sponding conditional expectation will be written Ex[f(x)|z]. Similarly, the variance
is denoted var[f(x)], and for vector variables the covariance is written cov[x, y]. We
shall also use cov[x] as a shorthand notation for cov[x, x]. The concepts of expecta-
tions and covariances are introduced in Section 1.2.2.

If we have N values x1, . . . , xN of a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T,
we can combine the observations into a data matrix X in which the nth row of X
corresponds to the row vector xT
n. Thus the n, i element of X corresponds to the
ith element of the nth observation xn. For the case of one-dimensional variables we
shall denote such a matrix by x, which is a column vector whose nth element is xn.
Note that x (which has dimensionality N) uses a different typeface to distinguish it
from x (which has dimensionality D).

Introduction

The problem of searching for patterns in data is a fundamental one and has a long and
successful history. For instance, the extensive astronomical observations of Tycho
Brahe in the 16th century allowed Johannes Kepler to discover the empirical laws of
planetary motion, which in turn provided a springboard for the development of clas-
sical mechanics. Similarly, the discovery of regularities in atomic spectra played a
key role in the development and veriﬁcation of quantum physics in the early twenti-
eth century. The ﬁeld of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discov-
ery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of
these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.
Consider the example of recognizing handwritten digits, illustrated in Figure 1.1.
Each digit corresponds to a 28×28 pixel image and so can be represented by a vector
x comprising 784 real numbers. The goal is to build a machine that will take such a
vector x as input and that will produce the identity of the digit 0, . . . , 9 as the output.
This is a nontrivial problem due to the wide variability of handwriting. It could be

tackled using handcrafted rules or heuristics for distinguishing the digits based on
the shapes of the strokes, but in practice such an approach leads to a proliferation of
rules and of exceptions to the rules and so on, and invariably gives poor results.
Far better results can be obtained by adopting a machine learning approach in
which a large set of N digits {x1, . . . , xN} called a training set is used to tune the
parameters of an adaptive model. The categories of the digits in the training set
are known in advance, typically by inspecting them individually and hand-labelling
them. We can express the category of a digit using target vector t, which represents
the identity of the corresponding digit. Suitable techniques for representing cate-
gories in terms of vectors will be discussed later. Note that there is one such target
vector t for each digit image x.

The result of running the machine learning algorithm can be expressed as a
function y(x) which takes a new digit image x as input and that generates an output
vector y, encoded in the same way as the target vectors. The precise form of the
function y(x) is determined during the training phase, also known as the learning
phase, on the basis of the training data. Once the model is trained it can then de-
termine the identity of new digit images, which are said to comprise a test set. The
ability to categorize correctly new examples that differ from those used for train-
ing is known as generalization. In practical applications, the variability of the input
vectors will be such that the training data can comprise only a tiny fraction of all
possible input vectors, and so generalization is a central goal in pattern recognition.
For most practical applications, the original input variables are typically prepro-
cessed to transform them into some new space of variables where, it is hoped, the
pattern recognition problem will be easier to solve. For instance, in the digit recogni-
tion problem, the images of the digits are typically translated and scaled so that each
digit is contained within a box of a ﬁxed size. This greatly reduces the variability
within each digit class, because the location and scale of all the digits are now the
same, which makes it much easier for a subsequent pattern recognition algorithm
to distinguish between the different classes. This pre-processing stage is sometimes
also called feature extraction. Note that new test data must be pre-processed using
the same steps as the training data.

Pre-processing might also be performed in order to speed up computation. For
example, if the goal is real-time face detection in a high-resolution video stream,
the computer must handle huge numbers of pixels per second, and presenting these
directly to a complex pattern recognition algorithm may be computationally infeasi-
ble. Instead, the aim is to ﬁnd useful features that are fast to compute, and yet that

1. INTRODUCTION

also preserve useful discriminatory information enabling faces to be distinguished
from non-faces. These features are then used as the inputs to the pattern recognition
algorithm. For instance, the average value of the image intensity over a rectangular
subregion can be evaluated extremely efﬁciently (Viola and Jones, 2004), and a set of
such features can prove very effective in fast face detection. Because the number of
such features is smaller than the number of pixels, this kind of pre-processing repre-
sents a form of dimensionality reduction. Care must be taken during pre-processing
because often information is discarded, and if this information is important to the
solution of the problem then the overall accuracy of the system can suffer.

Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors
along with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning prob-
lems. Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each
input vector to one of a ﬁnite number of discrete categories, are called classiﬁcation
problems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then
the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the pre-
diction of the yield in a chemical manufacturing process in which the inputs consist
of the concentrations of reactants, the temperature, and the pressure.

In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input
vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such unsupervised
learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data,
where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input
space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional
space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization.

Finally, the technique of reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998) is con-
cerned with the problem of ﬁnding suitable actions to take in a given situation in
order to maximize a reward. Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of
optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them
by a process of trial and error. Typically there is a sequence of states and actions in
which the learning algorithm is interacting with its environment. In many cases, the
current action not only affects the immediate reward but also has an impact on the re-
ward at all subsequent time steps. For example, by using appropriate reinforcement
learning techniques a neural network can learn to play the game of backgammon to a
high standard (Tesauro, 1994). Here the network must learn to take a board position
as input, along with the result of a dice throw, and produce a strong move as the
output. This is done by having the network play against a copy of itself for perhaps a
million games. A major challenge is that a game of backgammon can involve dozens
of moves, and yet it is only at the end of the game that the reward, in the form of
victory, is achieved. The reward must then be attributed appropriately to all of the
moves that led to it, even though some moves will have been good ones and others
less so. This is an example of a credit assignment problem. A general feature of re-
inforcement learning is the trade-off between exploration, in which the system tries
out new kinds of actions to see how effective they are, and exploitation, in which
the system makes use of actions that are known to yield a high reward. Too strong
a focus on either exploration or exploitation will yield poor results. Reinforcement
learning continues to be an active area of machine learning research. However, a

detailed treatment lies beyond the scope of this book.

Although each of these tasks needs its own tools and techniques, many of the
key ideas that underpin them are common to all such problems. One of the main
goals of this chapter is to introduce, in a relatively informal way, several of the most
important of these concepts and to illustrate them using simple examples. Later in
the book we shall see these same ideas re-emerge in the context of more sophisti-
cated models that are applicable to real-world pattern recognition applications. This
chapter also provides a self-contained introduction to three important tools that will
be used throughout the book, namely probability theory, decision theory, and infor-
mation theory. Although these might sound like daunting topics, they are in fact
straightforward, and a clear understanding of them is essential if machine learning
techniques are to be used to best effect in practical applications.

1.1. Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting

We begin by introducing a simple regression problem, which we shall use as a run-
ning example throughout this chapter to motivate a number of key concepts. Sup-
pose we observe a real-valued input variable x and we wish to use this observation to
predict the value of a real-valued target variable t. For the present purposes, it is in-
structive to consider an artiﬁcial example using synthetically generated data because
we then know the precise process that generated the data for comparison against any
learned model. The data for this example is generated from the function sin(2πx)
with random noise included in the target values, as described in detail in Appendix A.
Now suppose that we are given a training set comprising N observations of x,
written x ≡ (x1, . . . , xN )T, together with corresponding observations of the values
of t, denoted t ≡ (t1, . . . , tN)T. Figure 1.2 shows a plot of a training set comprising
N = 10 data points. The input data set x in Figure 1.2 was generated by choos-
ing values of xn, for n = 1, . . . , N, spaced uniformly in range [0, 1], and the target
data set t was obtained by ﬁrst computing the corresponding values of the function

sin(2πx) and then adding a small level of random noise having a Gaussian distri-
bution (the Gaussian distribution is discussed in Section 1.2.4) to each such point in
order to obtain the corresponding value tn. By generating data in this way, we are
capturing a property of many real data sets, namely that they possess an underlying
regularity, which we wish to learn, but that individual observations are corrupted by
random noise. This noise might arise from intrinsically stochastic (i.e. random) pro-
cesses such as radioactive decay but more typically is due to there being sources of
variability that are themselves unobserved.

(cid:1)t of the target variable for some new value(cid:1)x of the input variable. As we shall see
set. Furthermore the observed data are corrupted with noise, and so for a given(cid:1)x
there is uncertainty as to the appropriate value for(cid:1)t. Probability theory, discussed

later, this involves implicitly trying to discover the underlying function sin(2πx).
This is intrinsically a difﬁcult problem as we have to generalize from a ﬁnite data

Our goal is to exploit this training set in order to make predictions of the value

in Section 1.2, provides a framework for expressing such uncertainty in a precise
and quantitative manner, and decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, allows us to
exploit this probabilistic representation in order to make predictions that are optimal
according to appropriate criteria.

For the moment, however, we shall proceed rather informally and consider a
simple approach based on curve ﬁtting. In particular, we shall ﬁt the data using a
polynomial function of the form

M(cid:2)

y(x, w) = w0 + w1x + w2x2 + . . . + wM xM =

wjxj

(1.1)

j=0

where M is the order of the polynomial, and xj denotes x raised to the power of j.
The polynomial coefﬁcients w0, . . . , wM are collectively denoted by the vector w.
Note that, although the polynomial function y(x, w) is a nonlinear function of x, it
is a linear function of the coefﬁcients w. Functions, such as the polynomial, which
are linear in the unknown parameters have important properties and are called linear
models and will be discussed extensively in Chapters 3 and 4.

The values of the coefﬁcients will be determined by ﬁtting the polynomial to the
training data. This can be done by minimizing an error function that measures the
misﬁt between the function y(x, w), for any given value of w, and the training set
data points. One simple choice of error function, which is widely used, is given by
the sum of the squares of the errors between the predictions y(xn, w) for each data
point xn and the corresponding target values tn, so that we minimize

E(w) =

(1.2)

N(cid:2)

n=1

where the factor of 1/2 is included for later convenience. We shall discuss the mo-
tivation for this choice of error function later in this chapter. For the moment we
simply note that it is a nonnegative quantity that would be zero if, and only if, the

function y(x, w) were to pass exactly through each training data point. The geomet-
rical interpretation of the sum-of-squares error function is illustrated in Figure 1.3.

We can solve the curve ﬁtting problem by choosing the value of w for which
E(w) is as small as possible. Because the error function is a quadratic function of
the coefﬁcients w, its derivatives with respect to the coefﬁcients will be linear in the
elements of w, and so the minimization of the error function has a unique solution,
denoted by w(cid:1), which can be found in closed form. The resulting polynomial is
given by the function y(x, w(cid:1)).

There remains the problem of choosing the order M of the polynomial, and as
we shall see this will turn out to be an example of an important concept called model
comparison or model selection. In Figure 1.4, we show four examples of the results
of ﬁtting polynomials having orders M = 0, 1, 3, and 9 to the data set shown in
Figure 1.2.

We notice that the constant (M = 0) and ﬁrst order (M = 1) polynomials
give rather poor ﬁts to the data and consequently rather poor representations of the
function sin(2πx). The third order (M = 3) polynomial seems to give the best ﬁt
to the function sin(2πx) of the examples shown in Figure 1.4. When we go to a
much higher order polynomial (M = 9), we obtain an excellent ﬁt to the training
data. In fact, the polynomial passes exactly through each data point and E(w(cid:1)) = 0.
However, the ﬁtted curve oscillates wildly and gives a very poor representation of
the function sin(2πx). This latter behaviour is known as over-ﬁtting.

As we have noted earlier, the goal is to achieve good generalization by making
accurate predictions for new data. We can obtain some quantitative insight into the
dependence of the generalization performance on M by considering a separate test
set comprising 100 data points generated using exactly the same procedure used
to generate the training set points but with new choices for the random noise values
included in the target values. For each choice of M, we can then evaluate the residual
value of E(w(cid:1)) given by (1.2) for the training data, and we can also evaluate E(w(cid:1))
for the test data set. It is sometimes more convenient to use the root-mean-square

in which the division by N allows us to compare different sizes of data sets on
an equal footing, and the square root ensures that ERMS is measured on the same
scale (and in the same units) as the target variable t. Graphs of the training and
test set RMS errors are shown, for various values of M, in Figure 1.5. The test
set error is a measure of how well we are doing in predicting the values of t for
new data observations of x. We note from Figure 1.5 that small values of M give
relatively large values of the test set error, and this can be attributed to the fact that
the corresponding polynomials are rather inﬂexible and are incapable of capturing
the oscillations in the function sin(2πx). Values of M in the range 3 (cid:1) M (cid:1) 8
give small values for the test set error, and these also give reasonable representations
of the generating function sin(2πx), as can be seen, for the case of M = 3, from
Figure 1.4.

For M = 9, the training set error goes to zero, as we might expect because
this polynomial contains 10 degrees of freedom corresponding to the 10 coefﬁcients
w0, . . . , w9, and so can be tuned exactly to the 10 data points in the training set.
However, the test set error has become very large and, as we saw in Figure 1.4, the
corresponding function y(x, w(cid:1)) exhibits wild oscillations.

This may seem paradoxical because a polynomial of given order contains all
lower order polynomials as special cases. The M = 9 polynomial is therefore capa-
ble of generating results at least as good as the M = 3 polynomial. Furthermore, we
might suppose that the best predictor of new data would be the function sin(2πx)
from which the data was generated (and we shall see later that this is indeed the
case). We know that a power series expansion of the function sin(2πx) contains
terms of all orders, so we might expect that results should improve monotonically as
we increase M.

We can gain some insight into the problem by examining the values of the co-
efﬁcients w(cid:1) obtained from polynomials of various order, as shown in Table 1.1.
We see that, as M increases, the magnitude of the coefﬁcients typically gets larger.
In particular for the M = 9 polynomial, the coefﬁcients have become ﬁnely tuned
to the data by developing large positive and negative values so that the correspond-

Figure 1.6 Plots of the solutions obtained by minimizing the sum-of-squares error function using the M = 9
polynomial for N = 15 data points (left plot) and N = 100 data points (right plot). We see that increasing the
size of the data set reduces the over-ﬁtting problem.

ing polynomial function matches each of the data points exactly, but between data
points (particularly near the ends of the range) the function exhibits the large oscilla-
tions observed in Figure 1.4. Intuitively, what is happening is that the more ﬂexible
polynomials with larger values of M are becoming increasingly tuned to the random
noise on the target values.

It is also interesting to examine the behaviour of a given model as the size of the
data set is varied, as shown in Figure 1.6. We see that, for a given model complexity,
the over-ﬁtting problem become less severe as the size of the data set increases.
Another way to say this is that the larger the data set, the more complex (in other
words more ﬂexible) the model that we can afford to ﬁt to the data. One rough
heuristic that is sometimes advocated is that the number of data points should be
no less than some multiple (say 5 or 10) of the number of adaptive parameters in
the model. However, as we shall see in Chapter 3, the number of parameters is not
necessarily the most appropriate measure of model complexity.

Also, there is something rather unsatisfying about having to limit the number of
parameters in a model according to the size of the available training set. It would
seem more reasonable to choose the complexity of the model according to the com-
plexity of the problem being solved. We shall see that the least squares approach
to ﬁnding the model parameters represents a speciﬁc case of maximum likelihood
(discussed in Section 1.2.5), and that the over-ﬁtting problem can be understood as
a general property of maximum likelihood. By adopting a Bayesian approach, the
over-ﬁtting problem can be avoided. We shall see that there is no difﬁculty from
a Bayesian perspective in employing models for which the number of parameters
greatly exceeds the number of data points. Indeed, in a Bayesian model the effective
number of parameters adapts automatically to the size of the data set.

For the moment, however, it is instructive to continue with the current approach
and to consider how in practice we can apply it to data sets of limited size where we

may wish to use relatively complex and ﬂexible models. One technique that is often
used to control the over-ﬁtting phenomenon in such cases is that of regularization,
which involves adding a penalty term to the error function (1.2) in order to discourage
the coefﬁcients from reaching large values. The simplest such penalty term takes the
form of a sum of squares of all of the coefﬁcients, leading to a modiﬁed error function
of the form

where (cid:6)w(cid:6)2 ≡ wTw = w2
M , and the coefﬁcient λ governs the rel-
ative importance of the regularization term compared with the sum-of-squares error
term. Note that often the coefﬁcient w0 is omitted from the regularizer because its
inclusion causes the results to depend on the choice of origin for the target variable
(Hastie et al., 2001), or it may be included but with its own regularization coefﬁcient
(we shall discuss this topic in more detail in Section 5.5.1). Again, the error function
in (1.4) can be minimized exactly in closed form. Techniques such as this are known
in the statistics literature as shrinkage methods because they reduce the value of the
coefﬁcients. The particular case of a quadratic regularizer is called ridge regres-
sion (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970). In the context of neural networks, this approach is
known as weight decay.

Figure 1.7 shows the results of ﬁtting the polynomial of order M = 9 to the
same data set as before but now using the regularized error function given by (1.4).
We see that, for a value of ln λ = −18, the over-ﬁtting has been suppressed and we
now obtain a much closer representation of the underlying function sin(2πx). If,
however, we use too large a value for λ then we again obtain a poor ﬁt, as shown in
Figure 1.7 for ln λ = 0. The corresponding coefﬁcients from the ﬁtted polynomials
are given in Table 1.2, showing that regularization has the desired effect of reducing

the magnitude of the coefﬁcients.

The impact of the regularization term on the generalization error can be seen by
plotting the value of the RMS error (1.3) for both training and test sets against ln λ,
as shown in Figure 1.8. We see that in effect λ now controls the effective complexity
of the model and hence determines the degree of over-ﬁtting.

The issue of model complexity is an important one and will be discussed at
length in Section 1.3. Here we simply note that, if we were trying to solve a practical
application using this approach of minimizing an error function, we would have to
ﬁnd a way to determine a suitable value for the model complexity. The results above
suggest a simple way of achieving this, namely by taking the available data and
partitioning it into a training set, used to determine the coefﬁcients w, and a separate
validation set, also called a hold-out set, used to optimize the model complexity
(either M or λ).
In many cases, however, this will prove to be too wasteful of
valuable training data, and we have to seek more sophisticated approaches.

So far our discussion of polynomial curve ﬁtting has appealed largely to in-
tuition. We now seek a more principled approach to solving problems in pattern
recognition by turning to a discussion of probability theory. As well as providing the
foundation for nearly all of the subsequent developments in this book, it will also

1. INTRODUCTION

give us some important insights into the concepts we have introduced in the con-
text of polynomial curve ﬁtting and will allow us to extend these to more complex
situations.

1.2. Probability Theory

A key concept in the ﬁeld of pattern recognition is that of uncertainty. It arises both
through noise on measurements, as well as through the ﬁnite size of data sets. Prob-
ability theory provides a consistent framework for the quantiﬁcation and manipula-
tion of uncertainty and forms one of the central foundations for pattern recognition.
When combined with decision theory, discussed in Section 1.5, it allows us to make
optimal predictions given all the information available to us, even though that infor-
mation may be incomplete or ambiguous.

We will introduce the basic concepts of probability theory by considering a sim-
ple example. Imagine we have two boxes, one red and one blue, and in the red box
we have 2 apples and 6 oranges, and in the blue box we have 3 apples and 1 orange.
This is illustrated in Figure 1.9. Now suppose we randomly pick one of the boxes
and from that box we randomly select an item of fruit, and having observed which
sort of fruit it is we replace it in the box from which it came. We could imagine
repeating this process many times. Let us suppose that in so doing we pick the red
box 40% of the time and we pick the blue box 60% of the time, and that when we
remove an item of fruit from a box we are equally likely to select any of the pieces
of fruit in the box.

In this example, the identity of the box that will be chosen is a random variable,
which we shall denote by B. This random variable can take one of two possible
values, namely r (corresponding to the red box) or b (corresponding to the blue
box). Similarly, the identity of the fruit is also a random variable and will be denoted
by F . It can take either of the values a (for apple) or o (for orange).

To begin with, we shall deﬁne the probability of an event to be the fraction
of times that event occurs out of the total number of trials, in the limit that the total
number of trials goes to inﬁnity. Thus the probability of selecting the red box is 4/10

Figure 1.9 We use a simple example of two
coloured boxes each containing fruit
(apples shown in green and or-
anges shown in orange) to intro-
duce the basic ideas of probability.

1.2. Probability Theory

Figure 1.10 We can derive the sum and product rules of probability by
considering two random variables, X, which takes the values {xi} where
i = 1, . . . , M, and Y , which takes the values {yj} where j = 1, . . . , L.
In this illustration we have M = 5 and L = 3.
If we consider a total
number N of instances of these variables, then we denote the number
of instances where X = xi and Y = yj by nij, which is the number of
points in the corresponding cell of the array. The number of points in
column i, corresponding to X = xi, is denoted by ci, and the number of
points in row j, corresponding to Y = yj, is denoted by rj.

and the probability of selecting the blue box is 6/10. We write these probabilities
as p(B = r) = 4/10 and p(B = b) = 6/10. Note that, by deﬁnition, probabilities
must lie in the interval [0, 1]. Also, if the events are mutually exclusive and if they
include all possible outcomes (for instance, in this example the box must be either
red or blue), then we see that the probabilities for those events must sum to one.

We can now ask questions such as: “what is the overall probability that the se-
lection procedure will pick an apple?”, or “given that we have chosen an orange,
what is the probability that the box we chose was the blue one?”. We can answer
questions such as these, and indeed much more complex questions associated with
problems in pattern recognition, once we have equipped ourselves with the two el-
ementary rules of probability, known as the sum rule and the product rule. Having
obtained these rules, we shall then return to our boxes of fruit example.

In order to derive the rules of probability, consider the slightly more general ex-
ample shown in Figure 1.10 involving two random variables X and Y (which could
for instance be the Box and Fruit variables considered above). We shall suppose that
X can take any of the values xi where i = 1, . . . , M, and Y can take the values yj
where j = 1, . . . , L. Consider a total of N trials in which we sample both of the
variables X and Y , and let the number of such trials in which X = xi and Y = yj
be nij. Also, let the number of trials in which X takes the value xi (irrespective
of the value that Y takes) be denoted by ci, and similarly let the number of trials in
which Y takes the value yj be denoted by rj.

The probability that X will take the value xi and Y will take the value yj is
written p(X = xi, Y = yj) and is called the joint probability of X = xi and
Y = yj. It is given by the number of points falling in the cell i,j as a fraction of the
total number of points, and hence

p(X = xi, Y = yj) = nij
N

(1.5)
Here we are implicitly considering the limit N → ∞. Similarly, the probability that
X takes the value xi irrespective of the value of Y is written as p(X = xi) and is
given by the fraction of the total number of points that fall in column i, so that

.

p(X = xi) = ci
N

.

Because the number of instances in column i in Figure 1.10 is just the sum of the
number of instances in each cell of that column, we have ci =
j nij and therefore,

(1.6)

1. INTRODUCTION

from (1.5) and (1.6), we have

p(X = xi) =

L(cid:2)

j=1

p(X = xi, Y = yj)

(1.7)

which is the sum rule of probability. Note that p(X = xi) is sometimes called the
marginal probability, because it is obtained by marginalizing, or summing out, the
other variables (in this case Y ).
If we consider only those instances for which X = xi, then the fraction of
such instances for which Y = yj is written p(Y = yj|X = xi) and is called the
conditional probability of Y = yj given X = xi.
It is obtained by ﬁnding the
fraction of those points in column i that fall in cell i,j and hence is given by

p(Y = yj|X = xi) = nij
ci

.

From (1.5), (1.6), and (1.8), we can then derive the following relationship

which is the product rule of probability.

So far we have been quite careful to make a distinction between a random vari-
able, such as the box B in the fruit example, and the values that the random variable
can take, for example r if the box were the red one. Thus the probability that B takes
the value r is denoted p(B = r). Although this helps to avoid ambiguity, it leads
to a rather cumbersome notation, and in many cases there will be no need for such
pedantry. Instead, we may simply write p(B) to denote a distribution over the ran-
dom variable B, or p(r) to denote the distribution evaluated for the particular value
r, provided that the interpretation is clear from the context.

With this more compact notation, we can write the two fundamental rules of

probability theory in the following form.

Here p(X, Y ) is a joint probability and is verbalized as “the probability of X and
Y ”. Similarly, the quantity p(Y |X) is a conditional probability and is verbalized as
“the probability of Y given X”, whereas the quantity p(X) is a marginal probability

1.2. Probability Theory

and is simply “the probability of X”. These two simple rules form the basis for all
of the probabilistic machinery that we use throughout this book.

From the product rule, together with the symmetry property p(X, Y ) = p(Y, X),
we immediately obtain the following relationship between conditional probabilities

p(Y |X) = p(X|Y )p(Y )

p(X)

(1.12)

which is called Bayes’ theorem and which plays a central role in pattern recognition
and machine learning. Using the sum rule, the denominator in Bayes’ theorem can
be expressed in terms of the quantities appearing in the numerator

(cid:2)

p(X) =

p(X|Y )p(Y ).

(1.13)

Y

We can view the denominator in Bayes’ theorem as being the normalization constant
required to ensure that the sum of the conditional probability on the left-hand side of
(1.12) over all values of Y equals one.

In Figure 1.11, we show a simple example involving a joint distribution over two
variables to illustrate the concept of marginal and conditional distributions. Here
a ﬁnite sample of N = 60 data points has been drawn from the joint distribution
and is shown in the top left. In the top right is a histogram of the fractions of data
points having each of the two values of Y . From the deﬁnition of probability, these
fractions would equal the corresponding probabilities p(Y ) in the limit N → ∞. We
can view the histogram as a simple way to model a probability distribution given only
a ﬁnite number of points drawn from that distribution. Modelling distributions from
data lies at the heart of statistical pattern recognition and will be explored in great
detail in this book. The remaining two plots in Figure 1.11 show the corresponding
histogram estimates of p(X) and p(X|Y = 1).

Let us now return to our example involving boxes of fruit. For the moment, we
shall once again be explicit about distinguishing between the random variables and
their instantiations. We have seen that the probabilities of selecting either the red or
the blue boxes are given by

p(B = r) = 4/10
p(B = b) = 6/10

(1.14)
(1.15)

respectively. Note that these satisfy p(B = r) + p(B = b) = 1.

Now suppose that we pick a box at random, and it turns out to be the blue box.
Then the probability of selecting an apple is just the fraction of apples in the blue
box which is 3/4, and so p(F = a|B = b) = 3/4. In fact, we can write out all four
conditional probabilities for the type of fruit, given the selected box

p(F = a|B = r) = 1/4
p(F = o|B = r) = 3/4
p(F = a|B = b) = 3/4
p(F = o|B = b) = 1/4.

Again, note that these probabilities are normalized so that

p(F = a|B = r) + p(F = o|B = r) = 1

and similarly

p(F = a|B = b) + p(F = o|B = b) = 1.

We can now use the sum and product rules of probability to evaluate the overall

Suppose instead we are told that a piece of fruit has been selected and it is an
orange, and we would like to know which box it came from. This requires that
we evaluate the probability distribution over boxes conditioned on the identity of
the fruit, whereas the probabilities in (1.16)–(1.19) give the probability distribution
over the fruit conditioned on the identity of the box. We can solve the problem of
reversing the conditional probability by using Bayes’ theorem to give

From the sum rule, it then follows that p(B = b|F = o) = 1 − 2/3 = 1/3.

(1.23)

We can provide an important interpretation of Bayes’ theorem as follows. If
we had been asked which box had been chosen before being told the identity of
the selected item of fruit, then the most complete information we have available is
provided by the probability p(B). We call this the prior probability because it is the
probability available before we observe the identity of the fruit. Once we are told that
the fruit is an orange, we can then use Bayes’ theorem to compute the probability
p(B|F ), which we shall call the posterior probability because it is the probability
obtained after we have observed F . Note that in this example, the prior probability
of selecting the red box was 4/10, so that we were more likely to select the blue box
than the red one. However, once we have observed that the piece of selected fruit is
an orange, we ﬁnd that the posterior probability of the red box is now 2/3, so that
it is now more likely that the box we selected was in fact the red one. This result
accords with our intuition, as the proportion of oranges is much higher in the red box
than it is in the blue box, and so the observation that the fruit was an orange provides
signiﬁcant evidence favouring the red box. In fact, the evidence is sufﬁciently strong
that it outweighs the prior and makes it more likely that the red box was chosen
rather than the blue one.

Finally, we note that if the joint distribution of two variables factorizes into the
product of the marginals, so that p(X, Y ) = p(X)p(Y ), then X and Y are said to
be independent. From the product rule, we see that p(Y |X) = p(Y ), and so the
conditional distribution of Y given X is indeed independent of the value of X. For
instance, in our boxes of fruit example, if each box contained the same fraction of
apples and oranges, then p(F|B) = P (F ), so that the probability of selecting, say,
an apple is independent of which box is chosen.

1.2.1 Probability densities
As well as considering probabilities deﬁned over discrete sets of events, we
also wish to consider probabilities with respect to continuous variables. We shall
limit ourselves to a relatively informal discussion. If the probability of a real-valued
variable x falling in the interval (x, x + δx) is given by p(x)δx for δx → 0, then
p(x) is called the probability density over x. This is illustrated in Figure 1.12. The
probability that x will lie in an interval (a, b) is then given by

(cid:6) b

p(x ∈ (a, b)) =

p(x) dx.

1. INTRODUCTION

Figure 1.12 The concept of probability for
discrete variables can be ex-
tended to that of a probability
density p(x) over a continuous
variable x and is such that the
probability of x lying in the inter-
val (x, x + δx) is given by p(x)δx
for δx → 0. The probability
density can be expressed as the
derivative of a cumulative distri-
bution function P (x).

Because probabilities are nonnegative, and because the value of x must lie some-
where on the real axis, the probability density p(x) must satisfy the two conditions

p(x) (cid:2) 0

p(x) dx = 1.

−∞

(1.25)

(1.26)

Under a nonlinear change of variable, a probability density transforms differently
from a simple function, due to the Jacobian factor. For instance, if we consider

a change of variables x = g(y), then a function f(x) becomes(cid:4)f(y) = f(g(y)).

Now consider a probability density px(x) that corresponds to a density py(y) with
respect to the new variable y, where the sufﬁces denote the fact that px(x) and py(y)
are different densities. Observations falling in the range (x, x + δx) will, for small
values of δx, be transformed into the range (y, y + δy) where px(x)δx (cid:8) py(y)δy,
and hence

(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7) dx

(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)

py(y) = px(x)

dy
= px(g(y))|g

(cid:2)(y)| .

(1.27)

Exercise 1.4

One consequence of this property is that the concept of the maximum of a probability
density is dependent on the choice of variable.
The probability that x lies in the interval (−∞, z) is given by the cumulative

distribution function deﬁned by

(cid:6) z

P (z) =

p(x) dx

−∞

(1.28)

which satisﬁes P

(cid:2)(x) = p(x), as shown in Figure 1.12.

If we have several continuous variables x1, . . . , xD, denoted collectively by the
vector x, then we can deﬁne a joint probability density p(x) = p(x1, . . . , xD) such

1.2. Probability Theory

19

that the probability of x falling in an inﬁnitesimal volume δx containing the point x
is given by p(x)δx. This multivariate probability density must satisfy

(cid:6)

p(x) (cid:2) 0
p(x) dx = 1

(1.29)

(1.30)

in which the integral is taken over the whole of x space. We can also consider joint
probability distributions over a combination of discrete and continuous variables.

Note that if x is a discrete variable, then p(x) is sometimes called a probability
mass function because it can be regarded as a set of ‘probability masses’ concentrated
at the allowed values of x.

The sum and product rules of probability, as well as Bayes’ theorem, apply
equally to the case of probability densities, or to combinations of discrete and con-
tinuous variables. For instance, if x and y are two real variables, then the sum and
product rules take the form

(cid:6)

p(x) =

p(x, y) dy
p(x, y) = p(y|x)p(x).

(1.31)

(1.32)

A formal justiﬁcation of the sum and product rules for continuous variables (Feller,
1966) requires a branch of mathematics called measure theory and lies outside the
scope of this book. Its validity can be seen informally, however, by dividing each
real variable into intervals of width ∆ and considering the discrete probability dis-
tribution over these intervals. Taking the limit ∆ → 0 then turns sums into integrals
and gives the desired result.

1.2.2 Expectations and covariances
One of the most important operations involving probabilities is that of ﬁnding
weighted averages of functions. The average value of some function f(x) under a
probability distribution p(x) is called the expectation of f(x) and will be denoted by
E[f]. For a discrete distribution, it is given by

(cid:2)

E[f] =

p(x)f(x)

(1.33)

x

so that the average is weighted by the relative probabilities of the different values
of x. In the case of continuous variables, expectations are expressed in terms of an
integration with respect to the corresponding probability density

(cid:6)

E[f] =

p(x)f(x) dx.

(1.34)

In either case, if we are given a ﬁnite number N of points drawn from the probability
distribution or probability density, then the expectation can be approximated as a

20

1. INTRODUCTION

ﬁnite sum over these points

N(cid:2)

n=1

E[f] (cid:8) 1
N

f(xn).

(1.35)

We shall make extensive use of this result when we discuss sampling methods in
Chapter 11. The approximation in (1.35) becomes exact in the limit N → ∞.

Sometimes we will be considering expectations of functions of several variables,
in which case we can use a subscript to indicate which variable is being averaged
over, so that for instance

(1.36)
denotes the average of the function f(x, y) with respect to the distribution of x. Note
that Ex[f(x, y)] will be a function of y.

Ex[f(x, y)]

We can also consider a conditional expectation with respect to a conditional

distribution, so that

Ex[f|y] =

p(x|y)f(x)

(cid:2)
(cid:8)
(f(x) − E[f(x)])2(cid:9)

x

with an analogous deﬁnition for continuous variables.

The variance of f(x) is deﬁned by

var[f] = E

(1.37)

(1.38)

Exercise 1.5

Exercise 1.6

and provides a measure of how much variability there is in f(x) around its mean
value E[f(x)]. Expanding out the square, we see that the variance can also be written
in terms of the expectations of f(x) and f(x)2

var[f] = E[f(x)2] − E[f(x)]2.

(1.39)

In particular, we can consider the variance of the variable x itself, which is given by

var[x] = E[x2] − E[x]2.

For two random variables x and y, the covariance is deﬁned by

cov[x, y] = Ex,y [{x − E[x]}{y − E[y]}]

= Ex,y[xy] − E[x]E[y]

(1.40)

(1.41)

which expresses the extent to which x and y vary together. If x and y are indepen-
dent, then their covariance vanishes.

In the case of two vectors of random variables x and y, the covariance is a matrix

(cid:8){x − E[x]}{yT − E[yT]}(cid:9)

cov[x, y] = Ex,y

= Ex,y[xyT] − E[x]E[yT].

(1.42)

If we consider the covariance of the components of a vector x with each other, then
we use a slightly simpler notation cov[x] ≡ cov[x, x].

1.2.3 Bayesian probabilities
So far in this chapter, we have viewed probabilities in terms of the frequencies
of random, repeatable events. We shall refer to this as the classical or frequentist
interpretation of probability. Now we turn to the more general Bayesian view, in
which probabilities provide a quantiﬁcation of uncertainty.

Consider an uncertain event, for example whether the moon was once in its own
orbit around the sun, or whether the Arctic ice cap will have disappeared by the end
of the century. These are not events that can be repeated numerous times in order
to deﬁne a notion of probability as we did earlier in the context of boxes of fruit.
Nevertheless, we will generally have some idea, for example, of how quickly we
think the polar ice is melting. If we now obtain fresh evidence, for instance from a
new Earth observation satellite gathering novel forms of diagnostic information, we
may revise our opinion on the rate of ice loss. Our assessment of such matters will
affect the actions we take, for instance the extent to which we endeavour to reduce
the emission of greenhouse gasses. In such circumstances, we would like to be able
to quantify our expression of uncertainty and make precise revisions of uncertainty in
the light of new evidence, as well as subsequently to be able to take optimal actions
or decisions as a consequence. This can all be achieved through the elegant, and very
general, Bayesian interpretation of probability.

The use of probability to represent uncertainty, however, is not an ad-hoc choice,
but is inevitable if we are to respect common sense while making rational coherent
inferences. For instance, Cox (1946) showed that if numerical values are used to
represent degrees of belief, then a simple set of axioms encoding common sense
properties of such beliefs leads uniquely to a set of rules for manipulating degrees of
belief that are equivalent to the sum and product rules of probability. This provided
the ﬁrst rigorous proof that probability theory could be regarded as an extension of
Boolean logic to situations involving uncertainty (Jaynes, 2003). Numerous other
authors have proposed different sets of properties or axioms that such measures of
uncertainty should satisfy (Ramsey, 1931; Good, 1950; Savage, 1961; deFinetti,
1970; Lindley, 1982). In each case, the resulting numerical quantities behave pre-
cisely according to the rules of probability. It is therefore natural to refer to these
quantities as (Bayesian) probabilities.

In the ﬁeld of pattern recognition, too, it is helpful to have a more general no-

Thomas Bayes
1701–1761

Thomas Bayes was born in Tun-
bridge Wells and was a clergyman
as well as an amateur scientist and
a mathematician. He studied logic
and theology at Edinburgh Univer-
sity and was elected Fellow of the
Royal Society in 1742. During the 18th century, is-
sues regarding probability arose in connection with

gambling and with the new concept of insurance. One
particularly important problem concerned so-called in-
verse probability. A solution was proposed by Thomas
Bayes in his paper ‘Essay towards solving a problem
in the doctrine of chances’, which was published in
1764, some three years after his death, in the Philo-
sophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
In fact,
Bayes only formulated his theory for the case of a uni-
form prior, and it was Pierre-Simon Laplace who inde-
pendently rediscovered the theory in general form and
who demonstrated its broad applicability.

22

1. INTRODUCTION

tion of probability. Consider the example of polynomial curve ﬁtting discussed in
Section 1.1. It seems reasonable to apply the frequentist notion of probability to the
random values of the observed variables tn. However, we would like to address and
quantify the uncertainty that surrounds the appropriate choice for the model param-
eters w. We shall see that, from a Bayesian perspective, we can use the machinery
of probability theory to describe the uncertainty in model parameters such as w, or
indeed in the choice of model itself.

Bayes’ theorem now acquires a new signiﬁcance. Recall that in the boxes of fruit
example, the observation of the identity of the fruit provided relevant information
that altered the probability that the chosen box was the red one. In that example,
Bayes’ theorem was used to convert a prior probability into a posterior probability
by incorporating the evidence provided by the observed data. As we shall see in
detail later, we can adopt a similar approach when making inferences about quantities
such as the parameters w in the polynomial curve ﬁtting example. We capture our
assumptions about w, before observing the data, in the form of a prior probability
distribution p(w). The effect of the observed data D = {t1, . . . , tN} is expressed
through the conditional probability p(D|w), and we shall see later, in Section 1.2.5,
how this can be represented explicitly. Bayes’ theorem, which takes the form

p(w|D) = p(D|w)p(w)

p(D)

(1.43)
then allows us to evaluate the uncertainty in w after we have observed D in the form
of the posterior probability p(w|D).
The quantity p(D|w) on the right-hand side of Bayes’ theorem is evaluated for
the observed data set D and can be viewed as a function of the parameter vector
w, in which case it is called the likelihood function. It expresses how probable the
observed data set is for different settings of the parameter vector w. Note that the
likelihood is not a probability distribution over w, and its integral with respect to w
does not (necessarily) equal one.

Given this deﬁnition of likelihood, we can state Bayes’ theorem in words

posterior ∝ likelihood × prior

(1.44)

where all of these quantities are viewed as functions of w. The denominator in
(1.43) is the normalization constant, which ensures that the posterior distribution
on the left-hand side is a valid probability density and integrates to one. Indeed,
integrating both sides of (1.43) with respect to w, we can express the denominator
in Bayes’ theorem in terms of the prior distribution and the likelihood function

(cid:6)

p(D) =

p(D|w)p(w) dw.

(1.45)
In both the Bayesian and frequentist paradigms, the likelihood function p(D|w)
plays a central role. However, the manner in which it is used is fundamentally dif-
ferent in the two approaches. In a frequentist setting, w is considered to be a ﬁxed
parameter, whose value is determined by some form of ‘estimator’, and error bars

1.2. Probability Theory

23

on this estimate are obtained by considering the distribution of possible data sets D.
By contrast, from the Bayesian viewpoint there is only a single data set D (namely
the one that is actually observed), and the uncertainty in the parameters is expressed
through a probability distribution over w.
A widely used frequentist estimator is maximum likelihood, in which w is set
to the value that maximizes the likelihood function p(D|w). This corresponds to
choosing the value of w for which the probability of the observed data set is maxi-
mized. In the machine learning literature, the negative log of the likelihood function
is called an error function. Because the negative logarithm is a monotonically de-
creasing function, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the error.
One approach to determining frequentist error bars is the bootstrap (Efron, 1979;
Hastie et al., 2001), in which multiple data sets are created as follows. Suppose our
original data set consists of N data points X = {x1, . . . , xN}. We can create a new
data set XB by drawing N points at random from X, with replacement, so that some
points in X may be replicated in XB, whereas other points in X may be absent from
XB. This process can be repeated L times to generate L data sets each of size N and
each obtained by sampling from the original data set X. The statistical accuracy of
parameter estimates can then be evaluated by looking at the variability of predictions
between the different bootstrap data sets.

One advantage of the Bayesian viewpoint is that the inclusion of prior knowl-
edge arises naturally. Suppose, for instance, that a fair-looking coin is tossed three
times and lands heads each time. A classical maximum likelihood estimate of the
probability of landing heads would give 1, implying that all future tosses will land
heads! By contrast, a Bayesian approach with any reasonable prior will lead to a
much less extreme conclusion.

There has been much controversy and debate associated with the relative mer-
its of the frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, which have not been helped by the
fact that there is no unique frequentist, or even Bayesian, viewpoint. For instance,
one common criticism of the Bayesian approach is that the prior distribution is of-
ten selected on the basis of mathematical convenience rather than as a reﬂection of
any prior beliefs. Even the subjective nature of the conclusions through their de-
pendence on the choice of prior is seen by some as a source of difﬁculty. Reducing
the dependence on the prior is one motivation for so-called noninformative priors.
However, these lead to difﬁculties when comparing different models, and indeed
Bayesian methods based on poor choices of prior can give poor results with high
conﬁdence. Frequentist evaluation methods offer some protection from such prob-
lems, and techniques such as cross-validation remain useful in areas such as model
comparison.

This book places a strong emphasis on the Bayesian viewpoint, reﬂecting the
huge growth in the practical importance of Bayesian methods in the past few years,
while also discussing useful frequentist concepts as required.

Although the Bayesian framework has its origins in the 18th century, the prac-
tical application of Bayesian methods was for a long time severely limited by the
difﬁculties in carrying through the full Bayesian procedure, particularly the need to
marginalize (sum or integrate) over the whole of parameter space, which, as we shall

Section 2.1

Section 2.4.3

Section 1.3

24

1. INTRODUCTION

see, is required in order to make predictions or to compare different models. The
development of sampling methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (discussed in
Chapter 11) along with dramatic improvements in the speed and memory capacity
of computers, opened the door to the practical use of Bayesian techniques in an im-
pressive range of problem domains. Monte Carlo methods are very ﬂexible and can
be applied to a wide range of models. However, they are computationally intensive
and have mainly been used for small-scale problems.

More recently, highly efﬁcient deterministic approximation schemes such as
variational Bayes and expectation propagation (discussed in Chapter 10) have been
developed. These offer a complementary alternative to sampling methods and have
allowed Bayesian techniques to be used in large-scale applications (Blei et al., 2003).

1.2.4 The Gaussian distribution
We shall devote the whole of Chapter 2 to a study of various probability dis-
tributions and their key properties. It is convenient, however, to introduce here one
of the most important probability distributions for continuous variables, called the
normal or Gaussian distribution. We shall make extensive use of this distribution in
the remainder of this chapter and indeed throughout much of the book.

For the case of a single real-valued variable x, the Gaussian distribution is de-

(cid:12)

(cid:13)

ﬁned by

N(cid:10)

(cid:11)

x|µ, σ2

(2πσ2)1/2 exp

2σ2 (x − µ)2

(1.46)

which is governed by two parameters: µ, called the mean, and σ2, called the vari-
ance. The square root of the variance, given by σ, is called the standard deviation,
and the reciprocal of the variance, written as β = 1/σ2, is called the precision. We
shall see the motivation for these terms shortly. Figure 1.13 shows a plot of the
Gaussian distribution.

From the form of (1.46) we see that the Gaussian distribution satisﬁes

N (x|µ, σ2) > 0.

(1.47)

Exercise 1.7

Also it is straightforward to show that the Gaussian is normalized, so that

It
is said that Laplace was seri-

point declared himself
to be the
best mathematician in France at the
time, a claim that was arguably true.
As well as being proliﬁc in mathe-
matics, he also made numerous contributions to as-
tronomy, including the nebular hypothesis by which the

earth is thought to have formed from the condensa-
tion and cooling of a large rotating disk of gas and
dust. In 1812 he published the ﬁrst edition of Th´eorie
Analytique des Probabilit´es, in which Laplace states
that “probability theory is nothing but common sense
reduced to calculation”. This work included a discus-
sion of the inverse probability calculation (later termed
Bayes’ theorem by Poincar´e), which he used to solve
problems in life expectancy, jurisprudence, planetary
masses, triangulation, and error estimation.

Because the parameter µ represents the average value of x under the distribution, it
is referred to as the mean. Similarly, for the second order moment

E[x2] =

x2 dx = µ2 + σ2.

(1.50)

From (1.49) and (1.50), it follows that the variance of x is given by

var[x] = E[x2] − E[x]2 = σ2

(1.51)

(cid:12)

(cid:13)

and hence σ2 is referred to as the variance parameter. The maximum of a distribution
is known as its mode. For a Gaussian, the mode coincides with the mean.

We are also interested in the Gaussian distribution deﬁned over a D-dimensional

vector x of continuous variables, which is given by

where the D-dimensional vector µ is called the mean, the D × D matrix Σ is called
the covariance, and |Σ| denotes the determinant of Σ. We shall make use of the
multivariate Gaussian distribution brieﬂy in this chapter, although its properties will
be studied in detail in Section 2.3.

note a data set of values {xn}, and
the likelihood function given by (1.53)
corresponds to the product of the blue
values. Maximizing the likelihood in-
volves adjusting the mean and vari-
ance of the Gaussian so as to maxi-
mize this product.

Now suppose that we have a data set of observations x = (x1, . . . , xN )T, rep-
resenting N observations of the scalar variable x. Note that we are using the type-
face x to distinguish this from a single observation of the vector-valued variable
(x1, . . . , xD)T, which we denote by x. We shall suppose that the observations are
drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution whose mean µ and variance σ2
are unknown, and we would like to determine these parameters from the data set.
Data points that are drawn independently from the same distribution are said to be
independent and identically distributed, which is often abbreviated to i.i.d. We have
seen that the joint probability of two independent events is given by the product of
the marginal probabilities for each event separately. Because our data set x is i.i.d.,
we can therefore write the probability of the data set, given µ and σ2, in the form

When viewed as a function of µ and σ2, this is the likelihood function for the Gaus-
sian and is interpreted diagrammatically in Figure 1.14.

One common criterion for determining the parameters in a probability distribu-
tion using an observed data set is to ﬁnd the parameter values that maximize the
likelihood function. This might seem like a strange criterion because, from our fore-
going discussion of probability theory, it would seem more natural to maximize the
probability of the parameters given the data, not the probability of the data given the
parameters. In fact, these two criteria are related, as we shall discuss in the context
of curve ﬁtting.

For the moment, however, we shall determine values for the unknown parame-
ters µ and σ2 in the Gaussian by maximizing the likelihood function (1.53). In prac-
tice, it is more convenient to maximize the log of the likelihood function. Because
the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function of its argument, maximization
of the log of a function is equivalent to maximization of the function itself. Taking
the log not only simpliﬁes the subsequent mathematical analysis, but it also helps
numerically because the product of a large number of small probabilities can easily
underﬂow the numerical precision of the computer, and this is resolved by computing
instead the sum of the log probabilities. From (1.46) and (1.53), the log likelihood

that we are performing a joint maximization of (1.54) with respect to µ and σ2, but
in the case of the Gaussian distribution the solution for µ decouples from that for σ2
so that we can ﬁrst evaluate (1.55) and then subsequently use this result to evaluate
(1.56).

Later in this chapter, and also in subsequent chapters, we shall highlight the sig-
niﬁcant limitations of the maximum likelihood approach. Here we give an indication
of the problem in the context of our solutions for the maximum likelihood param-
eter settings for the univariate Gaussian distribution. In particular, we shall show
that the maximum likelihood approach systematically underestimates the variance
of the distribution. This is an example of a phenomenon called bias and is related
to the problem of over-ﬁtting encountered in the context of polynomial curve ﬁtting.
We ﬁrst note that the maximum likelihood solutions µML and σ2
ML are functions of
the data set values x1, . . . , xN . Consider the expectations of these quantities with
respect to the data set values, which themselves come from a Gaussian distribution
with parameters µ and σ2. It is straightforward to show that

so that on average the maximum likelihood estimate will obtain the correct mean but

this result is given by Figure 1.15.

of a Gaussian. The green curve shows
the true Gaussian distribution from which

show the Gaussian distributions obtained
by ﬁtting to three data sets, each consist-
ing of two data points shown in blue, us-
ing the maximum likelihood results (1.55)
and (1.56). Averaged across the three data
sets, the mean is correct, but the variance
is systematically under-estimated because
it is measured relative to the sample mean
and not relative to the true mean.

(b)

(c)

In Section 10.1.3, we shall see how this result arises automatically when we adopt a
Bayesian approach.
Note that the bias of the maximum likelihood solution becomes less signiﬁcant
as the number N of data points increases, and in the limit N → ∞ the maximum
likelihood solution for the variance equals the true variance of the distribution that
generated the data. In practice, for anything other than small N, this bias will not
prove to be a serious problem. However, throughout this book we shall be interested
in more complex models with many parameters, for which the bias problems asso-
ciated with maximum likelihood will be much more severe. In fact, as we shall see,
the issue of bias in maximum likelihood lies at the root of the over-ﬁtting problem
that we encountered earlier in the context of polynomial curve ﬁtting.

1.2.5 Curve ﬁtting re-visited
We have seen how the problem of polynomial curve ﬁtting can be expressed in
terms of error minimization. Here we return to the curve ﬁtting example and view it
from a probabilistic perspective, thereby gaining some insights into error functions
and regularization, as well as taking us towards a full Bayesian treatment.

Section 1.1

The goal in the curve ﬁtting problem is to be able to make predictions for the
target variable t given some new value of the input variable x on the basis of a set of
training data comprising N input values x = (x1, . . . , xN )T and their corresponding
target values t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. We can express our uncertainty over the value of
the target variable using a probability distribution. For this purpose, we shall assume
that, given the value of x, the corresponding value of t has a Gaussian distribution
with a mean equal to the value y(x, w) of the polynomial curve given by (1.1). Thus
we have

p(t|x, w, β) = N(cid:10)

(cid:11)

t|y(x, w), β

−1

(1.60)

where, for consistency with the notation in later chapters, we have deﬁned a preci-
sion parameter β corresponding to the inverse variance of the distribution. This is
illustrated schematically in Figure 1.16.

Figure 1.16 Schematic illustration of a Gaus-
sian conditional distribution for t given x given by
(1.60), in which the mean is given by the polyno-
mial function y(x, w), and the precision is given
by the parameter β, which is related to the vari-
ance by β−1 = σ2.

We now use the training data {x, t} to determine the values of the unknown
parameters w and β by maximum likelihood. If the data are assumed to be drawn
independently from the distribution (1.60), then the likelihood function is given by

(cid:11)

p(t|x, w, β) =

(1.61)

As we did in the case of the simple Gaussian distribution earlier, it is convenient to
maximize the logarithm of the likelihood function. Substituting for the form of the
Gaussian distribution, given by (1.46), we obtain the log likelihood function in the
form

ln p(t|x, w, β) = − β

{y(xn, w) − tn}2 + N

ln(2π).

(1.62)

N(cid:2)

n=1

Consider ﬁrst the determination of the maximum likelihood solution for the polyno-
mial coefﬁcients, which will be denoted by wML. These are determined by maxi-
mizing (1.62) with respect to w. For this purpose, we can omit the last two terms
on the right-hand side of (1.62) because they do not depend on w. Also, we note
that scaling the log likelihood by a positive constant coefﬁcient does not alter the
location of the maximum with respect to w, and so we can replace the coefﬁcient
β/2 with 1/2. Finally, instead of maximizing the log likelihood, we can equivalently
minimize the negative log likelihood. We therefore see that maximizing likelihood is
equivalent, so far as determining w is concerned, to minimizing the sum-of-squares
error function deﬁned by (1.2). Thus the sum-of-squares error function has arisen as
a consequence of maximizing likelihood under the assumption of a Gaussian noise
distribution.

We can also use maximum likelihood to determine the precision parameter β of

the Gaussian conditional distribution. Maximizing (1.62) with respect to β gives

{y(xn, wML) − tn}2

(1.67)

Again we can ﬁrst determine the parameter vector wML governing the mean and sub-
sequently use this to ﬁnd the precision βML as was the case for the simple Gaussian
distribution.

Having determined the parameters w and β, we can now make predictions for
new values of x. Because we now have a probabilistic model, these are expressed
in terms of the predictive distribution that gives the probability distribution over t,
rather than simply a point estimate, and is obtained by substituting the maximum
likelihood parameters into (1.60) to give

(1.64)

p(t|x, wML, βML) = N(cid:10)
(cid:17)

(cid:18)(M +1)/2

Now let us take a step towards a more Bayesian approach and introduce a prior
distribution over the polynomial coefﬁcients w. For simplicity, let us consider a
Gaussian distribution of the form

(cid:20)

(cid:19)

− α

(1.65)

p(w|α) = N (w|0, α

α
2π

where α is the precision of the distribution, and M +1 is the total number of elements
in the vector w for an M th order polynomial. Variables such as α, which control
the distribution of model parameters, are called hyperparameters. Using Bayes’
theorem, the posterior distribution for w is proportional to the product of the prior
distribution and the likelihood function

p(w|x, t, α, β) ∝ p(t|x, w, β)p(w|α).

(1.66)

We can now determine w by ﬁnding the most probable value of w given the data,
in other words by maximizing the posterior distribution. This technique is called
maximum posterior, or simply MAP. Taking the negative logarithm of (1.66) and
combining with (1.62) and (1.65), we ﬁnd that the maximum of the posterior is
given by the minimum of

Thus we see that maximizing the posterior distribution is equivalent to minimizing
the regularized sum-of-squares error function encountered earlier in the form (1.4),
with a regularization parameter given by λ = α/β.

1.2.6 Bayesian curve ﬁtting
Although we have included a prior distribution p(w|α), we are so far still mak-
ing a point estimate of w and so this does not yet amount to a Bayesian treatment. In
a fully Bayesian approach, we should consistently apply the sum and product rules
of probability, which requires, as we shall see shortly, that we integrate over all val-
ues of w. Such marginalizations lie at the heart of Bayesian methods for pattern
recognition.

1.2. Probability Theory

31

In the curve ﬁtting problem, we are given the training data x and t, along with
a new test point x, and our goal is to predict the value of t. We therefore wish
to evaluate the predictive distribution p(t|x, x, t). Here we shall assume that the
parameters α and β are ﬁxed and known in advance (in later chapters we shall discuss
how such parameters can be inferred from data in a Bayesian setting).

A Bayesian treatment simply corresponds to a consistent application of the sum
and product rules of probability, which allow the predictive distribution to be written
in the form

(cid:6)

p(t|x, x, t) =

p(t|x, w)p(w|x, t) dw.

(1.68)
Here p(t|x, w) is given by (1.60), and we have omitted the dependence on α and
β to simplify the notation. Here p(w|x, t) is the posterior distribution over param-
eters, and can be found by normalizing the right-hand side of (1.66). We shall see
in Section 3.3 that, for problems such as the curve-ﬁtting example, this posterior
distribution is a Gaussian and can be evaluated analytically. Similarly, the integra-
tion in (1.68) can also be performed analytically with the result that the predictive
distribution is given by a Gaussian of the form

p(t|x, x, t) = N(cid:10)

t|m(x), s2(x)

(cid:11)

where the mean and variance are given by

N(cid:2)

s2(x) = β

Here the matrix S is given by

m(x) = βφ(x)TS

where I is the unit matrix, and we have deﬁned the vector φ(x) with elements
φi(x) = xi for i = 0, . . . , M.

We see that the variance, as well as the mean, of the predictive distribution in
(1.69) is dependent on x. The ﬁrst term in (1.71) represents the uncertainty in the
predicted value of t due to the noise on the target variables and was expressed already
−1
in the maximum likelihood predictive distribution (1.64) through β
ML. However, the
second term arises from the uncertainty in the parameters w and is a consequence
of the Bayesian treatment. The predictive distribution for the synthetic sinusoidal
regression problem is illustrated in Figure 1.17.

1.3. Model Selection

In our example of polynomial curve ﬁtting using least squares, we saw that there was
an optimal order of polynomial that gave the best generalization. The order of the
polynomial controls the number of free parameters in the model and thereby governs
the model complexity. With regularized least squares, the regularization coefﬁcient
λ also controls the effective complexity of the model, whereas for more complex
models, such as mixture distributions or neural networks there may be multiple pa-
rameters governing complexity.
In a practical application, we need to determine
the values of such parameters, and the principal objective in doing so is usually to
achieve the best predictive performance on new data. Furthermore, as well as ﬁnd-
ing the appropriate values for complexity parameters within a given model, we may
wish to consider a range of different types of model in order to ﬁnd the best one for
our particular application.

We have already seen that, in the maximum likelihood approach, the perfor-
mance on the training set is not a good indicator of predictive performance on un-
seen data due to the problem of over-ﬁtting. If data is plentiful, then one approach is
simply to use some of the available data to train a range of models, or a given model
with a range of values for its complexity parameters, and then to compare them on
independent data, sometimes called a validation set, and select the one having the
best predictive performance. If the model design is iterated many times using a lim-
ited size data set, then some over-ﬁtting to the validation data can occur and so it may
be necessary to keep aside a third test set on which the performance of the selected
model is ﬁnally evaluated.

In many applications, however, the supply of data for training and testing will be
limited, and in order to build good models, we wish to use as much of the available
data as possible for training. However, if the validation set is small, it will give a
relatively noisy estimate of predictive performance. One solution to this dilemma is
to use cross-validation, which is illustrated in Figure 1.18. This allows a proportion
(S − 1)/S of the available data to be used for training while making use of all of the

1.4. The Curse of Dimensionality

33

Figure 1.18 The technique of S-fold cross-validation,

illus-
trated here for the case of S = 4, involves tak-
ing the available data and partitioning it into S
groups (in the simplest case these are of equal
size). Then S − 1 of the groups are used to train
a set of models that are then evaluated on the re-
maining group. This procedure is then repeated
for all S possible choices for the held-out group,
indicated here by the red blocks, and the perfor-
mance scores from the S runs are then averaged.

data to assess performance. When data is particularly scarce, it may be appropriate
to consider the case S = N, where N is the total number of data points, which gives
the leave-one-out technique.

One major drawback of cross-validation is that the number of training runs that
must be performed is increased by a factor of S, and this can prove problematic for
models in which the training is itself computationally expensive. A further problem
with techniques such as cross-validation that use separate data to assess performance
is that we might have multiple complexity parameters for a single model (for in-
stance, there might be several regularization parameters). Exploring combinations
of settings for such parameters could, in the worst case, require a number of training
runs that is exponential in the number of parameters. Clearly, we need a better ap-
proach. Ideally, this should rely only on the training data and should allow multiple
hyperparameters and model types to be compared in a single training run. We there-
fore need to ﬁnd a measure of performance which depends only on the training data
and which does not suffer from bias due to over-ﬁtting.

Historically various ‘information criteria’ have been proposed that attempt to
correct for the bias of maximum likelihood by the addition of a penalty term to
compensate for the over-ﬁtting of more complex models. For example, the Akaike
information criterion, or AIC (Akaike, 1974), chooses the model for which the quan-
tity
(1.73)
is largest. Here p(D|wML) is the best-ﬁt log likelihood, and M is the number of
adjustable parameters in the model. A variant of this quantity, called the Bayesian
information criterion, or BIC, will be discussed in Section 4.4.1. Such criteria do
not take account of the uncertainty in the model parameters, however, and in practice
they tend to favour overly simple models. We therefore turn in Section 3.4 to a fully
Bayesian approach where we shall see how complexity penalties arise in a natural
and principled way.

ln p(D|wML) − M

1.4. The Curse of Dimensionality

In the polynomial curve ﬁtting example we had just one input variable x. For prac-
tical applications of pattern recognition, however, we will have to deal with spaces

of high dimensionality comprising many input variables. As we now discuss, this
poses some serious challenges and is an important factor inﬂuencing the design of
pattern recognition techniques.

In order to illustrate the problem we consider a synthetically generated data set
representing measurements taken from a pipeline containing a mixture of oil, wa-
ter, and gas (Bishop and James, 1993). These three materials can be present in one
of three different geometrical conﬁgurations known as ‘homogenous’, ‘annular’, and
‘laminar’, and the fractions of the three materials can also vary. Each data point com-
prises a 12-dimensional input vector consisting of measurements taken with gamma
ray densitometers that measure the attenuation of gamma rays passing along nar-
row beams through the pipe. This data set is described in detail in Appendix A.
Figure 1.19 shows 100 points from this data set on a plot showing two of the mea-
surements x6 and x7 (the remaining ten input values are ignored for the purposes of
this illustration). Each data point is labelled according to which of the three geomet-
rical classes it belongs to, and our goal is to use this data as a training set in order to
be able to classify a new observation (x6, x7), such as the one denoted by the cross
in Figure 1.19. We observe that the cross is surrounded by numerous red points, and
so we might suppose that it belongs to the red class. However, there are also plenty
of green points nearby, so we might think that it could instead belong to the green
class. It seems unlikely that it belongs to the blue class. The intuition here is that the
identity of the cross should be determined more strongly by nearby points from the
training set and less strongly by more distant points. In fact, this intuition turns out
to be reasonable and will be discussed more fully in later chapters.

How can we turn this intuition into a learning algorithm? One very simple ap-
proach would be to divide the input space into regular cells, as indicated in Fig-
ure 1.20. When we are given a test point and we wish to predict its class, we ﬁrst
decide which cell it belongs to, and we then ﬁnd all of the training data points that

to the solution of a classiﬁcation
problem in which the input space
is divided into cells and any new
test point is assigned to the class
that has a majority number of rep-
resentatives in the same cell as
the test point. As we shall see
shortly,
this simplistic approach
has some severe shortcomings.

fall in the same cell. The identity of the test point is predicted as being the same
as the class having the largest number of training points in the same cell as the test
point (with ties being broken at random).

There are numerous problems with this naive approach, but one of the most se-
vere becomes apparent when we consider its extension to problems having larger
numbers of input variables, corresponding to input spaces of higher dimensionality.
The origin of the problem is illustrated in Figure 1.21, which shows that, if we divide
a region of a space into regular cells, then the number of such cells grows exponen-
tially with the dimensionality of the space. The problem with an exponentially large
number of cells is that we would need an exponentially large quantity of training data
in order to ensure that the cells are not empty. Clearly, we have no hope of applying
such a technique in a space of more than a few variables, and so we need to ﬁnd a
more sophisticated approach.

We can gain further insight into the problems of high-dimensional spaces by
returning to the example of polynomial curve ﬁtting and considering how we would

extend this approach to deal with input spaces having several variables. If we have

take the form

As D increases, so the number of independent coefﬁcients (not all of the coefﬁcients
are independent due to interchange symmetries amongst the x variables) grows pro-
portionally to D3. In practice, to capture complex dependencies in the data, we may
need to use a higher-order polynomial. For a polynomial of order M, the growth in
the number of coefﬁcients is like DM . Although this is now a power law growth,
rather than an exponential growth, it still points to the method becoming rapidly
unwieldy and of limited practical utility.

Our geometrical intuitions, formed through a life spent in a space of three di-
mensions, can fail badly when we consider spaces of higher dimensionality. As a
simple example, consider a sphere of radius r = 1 in a space of D dimensions, and
ask what is the fraction of the volume of the sphere that lies between radius r = 1−
and r = 1. We can evaluate this fraction by noting that the volume of a sphere of
radius r in D dimensions must scale as rD, and so we write

VD(r) = KDrD

(1.75)

Exercise 1.18

where the constant KD depends only on D. Thus the required fraction is given by

Exercise 1.20

VD(1) − VD(1 − )

VD(1)

= 1 − (1 − )D

(1.76)

which is plotted as a function of  for various values of D in Figure 1.22. We see
that, for large D, this fraction tends to 1 even for small values of . Thus, in spaces
of high dimensionality, most of the volume of a sphere is concentrated in a thin shell
near the surface!

As a further example, of direct relevance to pattern recognition, consider the
behaviour of a Gaussian distribution in a high-dimensional space. If we transform
from Cartesian to polar coordinates, and then integrate out the directional variables,
we obtain an expression for the density p(r) as a function of radius r from the origin.
Thus p(r)δr is the probability mass inside a thin shell of thickness δr located at
radius r. This distribution is plotted, for various values of D, in Figure 1.23, and we
see that for large D the probability mass of the Gaussian is concentrated in a thin
shell.

The severe difﬁculty that can arise in spaces of many dimensions is sometimes
called the curse of dimensionality (Bellman, 1961). In this book, we shall make ex-
tensive use of illustrative examples involving input spaces of one or two dimensions,
because this makes it particularly easy to illustrate the techniques graphically. The
reader should be warned, however, that not all intuitions developed in spaces of low
dimensionality will generalize to spaces of many dimensions.

Although the curse of dimensionality certainly raises important issues for pat-
tern recognition applications, it does not prevent us from ﬁnding effective techniques
applicable to high-dimensional spaces. The reasons for this are twofold. First, real
data will often be conﬁned to a region of the space having lower effective dimension-
ality, and in particular the directions over which important variations in the target
variables occur may be so conﬁned. Second, real data will typically exhibit some
smoothness properties (at least locally) so that for the most part small changes in the
input variables will produce small changes in the target variables, and so we can ex-
ploit local interpolation-like techniques to allow us to make predictions of the target
variables for new values of the input variables. Successful pattern recognition tech-
niques exploit one or both of these properties. Consider, for example, an application
in manufacturing in which images are captured of identical planar objects on a con-
veyor belt, in which the goal is to determine their orientation. Each image is a point

1. INTRODUCTION

in a high-dimensional space whose dimensionality is determined by the number of
pixels. Because the objects can occur at different positions within the image and
in different orientations, there are three degrees of freedom of variability between
images, and a set of images will live on a three dimensional manifold embedded
within the high-dimensional space. Due to the complex relationships between the
object position or orientation and the pixel intensities, this manifold will be highly
nonlinear. If the goal is to learn a model that can take an input image and output the
orientation of the object irrespective of its position, then there is only one degree of
freedom of variability within the manifold that is signiﬁcant.

1.5. Decision Theory

We have seen in Section 1.2 how probability theory provides us with a consistent
mathematical framework for quantifying and manipulating uncertainty. Here we
turn to a discussion of decision theory that, when combined with probability theory,
allows us to make optimal decisions in situations involving uncertainty such as those
encountered in pattern recognition.

Suppose we have an input vector x together with a corresponding vector t of
target variables, and our goal is to predict t given a new value for x. For regression
problems, t will comprise continuous variables, whereas for classiﬁcation problems
t will represent class labels. The joint probability distribution p(x, t) provides a
complete summary of the uncertainty associated with these variables. Determination
of p(x, t) from a set of training data is an example of inference and is typically a
very difﬁcult problem whose solution forms the subject of much of this book. In
a practical application, however, we must often make a speciﬁc prediction for the
value of t, or more generally take a speciﬁc action based on our understanding of the
values t is likely to take, and this aspect is the subject of decision theory.

Consider, for example, a medical diagnosis problem in which we have taken an
X-ray image of a patient, and we wish to determine whether the patient has cancer
or not. In this case, the input vector x is the set of pixel intensities in the image,
and output variable t will represent the presence of cancer, which we denote by the
class C1, or the absence of cancer, which we denote by the class C2. We might, for
instance, choose t to be a binary variable such that t = 0 corresponds to class C1 and
t = 1 corresponds to class C2. We shall see later that this choice of label values is
particularly convenient for probabilistic models. The general inference problem then
involves determining the joint distribution p(x,Ck), or equivalently p(x, t), which
gives us the most complete probabilistic description of the situation. Although this
can be a very useful and informative quantity, in the end we must decide either to
give treatment to the patient or not, and we would like this choice to be optimal
in some appropriate sense (Duda and Hart, 1973). This is the decision step, and
it is the subject of decision theory to tell us how to make optimal decisions given
the appropriate probabilities. We shall see that the decision stage is generally very
simple, even trivial, once we have solved the inference problem.

Here we give an introduction to the key ideas of decision theory as required for

1.5. Decision Theory

39

the rest of the book. Further background, as well as more detailed accounts, can be
found in Berger (1985) and Bather (2000).

Before giving a more detailed analysis, let us ﬁrst consider informally how we
might expect probabilities to play a role in making decisions. When we obtain the
X-ray image x for a new patient, our goal is to decide which of the two classes to
assign to the image. We are interested in the probabilities of the two classes given
the image, which are given by p(Ck|x). Using Bayes’ theorem, these probabilities
can be expressed in the form

p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck)

p(x)

.

(1.77)

Note that any of the quantities appearing in Bayes’ theorem can be obtained from
the joint distribution p(x,Ck) by either marginalizing or conditioning with respect to
the appropriate variables. We can now interpret p(Ck) as the prior probability for the
class Ck, and p(Ck|x) as the corresponding posterior probability. Thus p(C1) repre-
sents the probability that a person has cancer, before we take the X-ray measurement.
Similarly, p(C1|x) is the corresponding probability, revised using Bayes’ theorem in
light of the information contained in the X-ray. If our aim is to minimize the chance
of assigning x to the wrong class, then intuitively we would choose the class having
the higher posterior probability. We now show that this intuition is correct, and we
also discuss more general criteria for making decisions.

1.5.1 Minimizing the misclassiﬁcation rate
Suppose that our goal is simply to make as few misclassiﬁcations as possible.
We need a rule that assigns each value of x to one of the available classes. Such a
rule will divide the input space into regions Rk called decision regions, one for each
class, such that all points in Rk are assigned to class Ck. The boundaries between
decision regions are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. Note that each
decision region need not be contiguous but could comprise some number of disjoint
regions. We shall encounter examples of decision boundaries and decision regions in
later chapters. In order to ﬁnd the optimal decision rule, consider ﬁrst of all the case
of two classes, as in the cancer problem for instance. A mistake occurs when an input
vector belonging to class C1 is assigned to class C2 or vice versa. The probability of
this occurring is given by

p(mistake) = p(x ∈ R1,C2) + p(x ∈ R2,C1)

p(x,C2) dx +

p(x,C1) dx.

We are free to choose the decision rule that assigns each point x to one of the two
classes. Clearly to minimize p(mistake) we should arrange that each x is assigned to
whichever class has the smaller value of the integrand in (1.78). Thus, if p(x,C1) >
p(x,C2) for a given value of x, then we should assign that x to class C1. From the
product rule of probability we have p(x,Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x). Because the factor
p(x) is common to both terms, we can restate this result as saying that the minimum

Figure 1.24 Schematic illustration of the joint probabilities p(x,Ck) for each of two classes plotted
against x, together with the decision boundary x = bx. Values of x (cid:2) bx are classiﬁed as
class C2 and hence belong to decision region R2, whereas points x < bx are classiﬁed
as C1 and belong to R1. Errors arise from the blue, green, and red regions, so that for
x < bx the errors are due to points from class C2 being misclassiﬁed as C1 (represented by
the sum of the red and green regions), and conversely for points in the region x (cid:2) bx the
errors are due to points from class C1 being misclassiﬁed as C2 (represented by the blue
region). As we vary the location bx of the decision boundary, the combined areas of the
blue and green regions remains constant, whereas the size of the red region varies. The
optimal choice for bx is where the curves for p(x,C1) and p(x,C2) cross, corresponding to
bx = x0, because in this case the red region disappears. This is equivalent to the minimum
misclassiﬁcation rate decision rule, which assigns each value of x to the class having the
higher posterior probability p(Ck|x).

probability of making a mistake is obtained if each value of x is assigned to the class
for which the posterior probability p(Ck|x) is largest. This result is illustrated for
two classes, and a single input variable x, in Figure 1.24.

For the more general case of K classes, it is slightly easier to maximize the

probability of being correct, which is given by

which is maximized when the regions Rk are chosen such that each x is assigned
to the class for which p(x,Ck) is largest. Again, using the product rule p(x,Ck) =
p(Ck|x)p(x), and noting that the factor of p(x) is common to all terms, we see
that each x should be assigned to the class having the largest posterior probability
p(Ck|x).

1.5.2 Minimizing the expected loss
For many applications, our objective will be more complex than simply mini-
mizing the number of misclassiﬁcations. Let us consider again the medical diagnosis
problem. We note that, if a patient who does not have cancer is incorrectly diagnosed
as having cancer, the consequences may be some patient distress plus the need for
further investigations. Conversely, if a patient with cancer is diagnosed as healthy,
the result may be premature death due to lack of treatment. Thus the consequences
of these two types of mistake can be dramatically different. It would clearly be better
to make fewer mistakes of the second kind, even if this was at the expense of making
more mistakes of the ﬁrst kind.

We can formalize such issues through the introduction of a loss function, also
called a cost function, which is a single, overall measure of loss incurred in taking
any of the available decisions or actions. Our goal is then to minimize the total loss
incurred. Note that some authors consider instead a utility function, whose value
they aim to maximize. These are equivalent concepts if we take the utility to be
simply the negative of the loss, and throughout this text we shall use the loss function
convention. Suppose that, for a new value of x, the true class is Ck and that we assign
x to class Cj (where j may or may not be equal to k). In so doing, we incur some
level of loss that we denote by Lkj, which we can view as the k, j element of a loss
matrix. For instance, in our cancer example, we might have a loss matrix of the form
shown in Figure 1.25. This particular loss matrix says that there is no loss incurred
if the correct decision is made, there is a loss of 1 if a healthy patient is diagnosed as
having cancer, whereas there is a loss of 1000 if a patient having cancer is diagnosed
as healthy.

The optimal solution is the one which minimizes the loss function. However,
the loss function depends on the true class, which is unknown. For a given input
vector x, our uncertainty in the true class is expressed through the joint probability
distribution p(x,Ck) and so we seek instead to minimize the average loss, where the
average is computed with respect to this distribution, which is given by

Each x can be assigned independently to one of the decision regions Rj. Our goal
is to choose the regions Rj in order to minimize the expected loss (1.80), which
k Lkjp(x,Ck). As before, we can use
implies that for each x we should minimize
the product rule p(x,Ck) = p(Ck|x)p(x) to eliminate the common factor of p(x).
Thus the decision rule that minimizes the expected loss is the one that assigns each

is a minimum. This is clearly trivial to do, once we know the posterior class proba-
bilities p(Ck|x).

1.5.3 The reject option
We have seen that classiﬁcation errors arise from the regions of input space
where the largest of the posterior probabilities p(Ck|x) is signiﬁcantly less than unity,
or equivalently where the joint distributions p(x,Ck) have comparable values. These
are the regions where we are relatively uncertain about class membership. In some
applications, it will be appropriate to avoid making decisions on the difﬁcult cases
in anticipation of a lower error rate on those examples for which a classiﬁcation de-
cision is made. This is known as the reject option. For example, in our hypothetical
medical illustration, it may be appropriate to use an automatic system to classify
those X-ray images for which there is little doubt as to the correct class, while leav-
ing a human expert to classify the more ambiguous cases. We can achieve this by
introducing a threshold θ and rejecting those inputs x for which the largest of the
posterior probabilities p(Ck|x) is less than or equal to θ. This is illustrated for the
case of two classes, and a single continuous input variable x, in Figure 1.26. Note
that setting θ = 1 will ensure that all examples are rejected, whereas if there are K
classes then setting θ < 1/K will ensure that no examples are rejected. Thus the
fraction of examples that get rejected is controlled by the value of θ.

We can easily extend the reject criterion to minimize the expected loss, when
a loss matrix is given, taking account of the loss incurred when a reject decision is
made.

1.5.4 Inference and decision
We have broken the classiﬁcation problem down into two separate stages, the
inference stage in which we use training data to learn a model for p(Ck|x), and the

Exercise 1.24

1.5. Decision Theory

43

subsequent decision stage in which we use these posterior probabilities to make op-
timal class assignments. An alternative possibility would be to solve both problems
together and simply learn a function that maps inputs x directly into decisions. Such
a function is called a discriminant function.

In fact, we can identify three distinct approaches to solving decision problems,
all of which have been used in practical applications. These are given, in decreasing
order of complexity, by:

(a) First solve the inference problem of determining the class-conditional densities
p(x|Ck) for each class Ck individually. Also separately infer the prior class
probabilities p(Ck). Then use Bayes’ theorem in the form

p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck)

(1.82)
to ﬁnd the posterior class probabilities p(Ck|x). As usual, the denominator
in Bayes’ theorem can be found in terms of the quantities appearing in the
numerator, because

p(x)

(cid:2)

p(x|Ck)p(Ck).

p(x) =

k

(1.83)
Equivalently, we can model the joint distribution p(x,Ck) directly and then
normalize to obtain the posterior probabilities. Having found the posterior
probabilities, we use decision theory to determine class membership for each
new input x. Approaches that explicitly or implicitly model the distribution of
inputs as well as outputs are known as generative models, because by sampling
from them it is possible to generate synthetic data points in the input space.

(b) First solve the inference problem of determining the posterior class probabilities
p(Ck|x), and then subsequently use decision theory to assign each new x to
one of the classes. Approaches that model the posterior probabilities directly
are called discriminative models.

(c) Find a function f(x), called a discriminant function, which maps each input x
directly onto a class label. For instance, in the case of two-class problems,
f(·) might be binary valued and such that f = 0 represents class C1 and f = 1
represents class C2. In this case, probabilities play no role.

Let us consider the relative merits of these three alternatives. Approach (a) is the
most demanding because it involves ﬁnding the joint distribution over both x and
Ck. For many applications, x will have high dimensionality, and consequently we
may need a large training set in order to be able to determine the class-conditional
densities to reasonable accuracy. Note that the class priors p(Ck) can often be esti-
mated simply from the fractions of the training set data points in each of the classes.
One advantage of approach (a), however, is that it also allows the marginal density
of data p(x) to be determined from (1.83). This can be useful for detecting new data
points that have low probability under the model and for which the predictions may

be of low accuracy, which is known as outlier detection or novelty detection (Bishop,
1994; Tarassenko, 1995).

However, if we only wish to make classiﬁcation decisions, then it can be waste-
ful of computational resources, and excessively demanding of data, to ﬁnd the joint
distribution p(x,Ck) when in fact we only really need the posterior probabilities
p(Ck|x), which can be obtained directly through approach (b). Indeed, the class-
conditional densities may contain a lot of structure that has little effect on the pos-
terior probabilities, as illustrated in Figure 1.27. There has been much interest in
exploring the relative merits of generative and discriminative approaches to machine
learning, and in ﬁnding ways to combine them (Jebara, 2004; Lasserre et al., 2006).
An even simpler approach is (c) in which we use the training data to ﬁnd a
discriminant function f(x) that maps each x directly onto a class label, thereby
combining the inference and decision stages into a single learning problem. In the
example of Figure 1.27, this would correspond to ﬁnding the value of x shown by
the vertical green line, because this is the decision boundary giving the minimum
probability of misclassiﬁcation.
With option (c), however, we no longer have access to the posterior probabilities
p(Ck|x). There are many powerful reasons for wanting to compute the posterior
probabilities, even if we subsequently use them to make decisions. These include:

Minimizing risk. Consider a problem in which the elements of the loss matrix are
subjected to revision from time to time (such as might occur in a ﬁnancial

1.5. Decision Theory

45

application). If we know the posterior probabilities, we can trivially revise the
minimum risk decision criterion by modifying (1.81) appropriately. If we have
only a discriminant function, then any change to the loss matrix would require
that we return to the training data and solve the classiﬁcation problem afresh.

Reject option. Posterior probabilities allow us to determine a rejection criterion that
will minimize the misclassiﬁcation rate, or more generally the expected loss,
for a given fraction of rejected data points.

Compensating for class priors. Consider our medical X-ray problem again, and
suppose that we have collected a large number of X-ray images from the gen-
eral population for use as training data in order to build an automated screening
system. Because cancer is rare amongst the general population, we might ﬁnd
that, say, only 1 in every 1,000 examples corresponds to the presence of can-
cer. If we used such a data set to train an adaptive model, we could run into
severe difﬁculties due to the small proportion of the cancer class. For instance,
a classiﬁer that assigned every point to the normal class would already achieve
99.9% accuracy and it would be difﬁcult to avoid this trivial solution. Also,
even a large data set will contain very few examples of X-ray images corre-
sponding to cancer, and so the learning algorithm will not be exposed to a
broad range of examples of such images and hence is not likely to generalize
well. A balanced data set in which we have selected equal numbers of exam-
ples from each of the classes would allow us to ﬁnd a more accurate model.
However, we then have to compensate for the effects of our modiﬁcations to
the training data. Suppose we have used such a modiﬁed data set and found
models for the posterior probabilities. From Bayes’ theorem (1.82), we see that
the posterior probabilities are proportional to the prior probabilities, which we
can interpret as the fractions of points in each class. We can therefore simply
take the posterior probabilities obtained from our artiﬁcially balanced data set
and ﬁrst divide by the class fractions in that data set and then multiply by the
class fractions in the population to which we wish to apply the model. Finally,
we need to normalize to ensure that the new posterior probabilities sum to one.
Note that this procedure cannot be applied if we have learned a discriminant
function directly instead of determining posterior probabilities.

Combining models. For complex applications, we may wish to break the problem
into a number of smaller subproblems each of which can be tackled by a sep-
arate module. For example, in our hypothetical medical diagnosis problem,
we may have information available from, say, blood tests as well as X-ray im-
ages. Rather than combine all of this heterogeneous information into one huge
input space, it may be more effective to build one system to interpret the X-
ray images and a different one to interpret the blood data. As long as each of
the two models gives posterior probabilities for the classes, we can combine
the outputs systematically using the rules of probability. One simple way to
do this is to assume that, for each class separately, the distributions of inputs
for the X-ray images, denoted by xI, and the blood data, denoted by xB, are

46

1. INTRODUCTION

independent, so that

p(xI, xB|Ck) = p(xI|Ck)p(xB|Ck).

(1.84)

Section 8.2

Section 8.2.2

Section 1.1

Appendix D

This is an example of conditional independence property, because the indepen-
dence holds when the distribution is conditioned on the class Ck. The posterior
probability, given both the X-ray and blood data, is then given by

p(Ck|xI, xB) ∝ p(xI, xB|Ck)p(Ck)
∝ p(xI|Ck)p(xB|Ck)p(Ck)
∝ p(Ck|xI)p(Ck|xB)

p(Ck)

(1.85)
Thus we need the class prior probabilities p(Ck), which we can easily estimate
from the fractions of data points in each class, and then we need to normalize
the resulting posterior probabilities so they sum to one. The particular condi-
tional independence assumption (1.84) is an example of the naive Bayes model.
Note that the joint marginal distribution p(xI, xB) will typically not factorize
under this model. We shall see in later chapters how to construct models for
combining data that do not require the conditional independence assumption
(1.84).

1.5.5 Loss functions for regression
So far, we have discussed decision theory in the context of classiﬁcation prob-
lems. We now turn to the case of regression problems, such as the curve ﬁtting
example discussed earlier. The decision stage consists of choosing a speciﬁc esti-
mate y(x) of the value of t for each input x. Suppose that in doing so, we incur a
loss L(t, y(x)). The average, or expected, loss is then given by

(cid:6)(cid:6)

E[L] =

L(t, y(x))p(x, t) dx dt.

(1.86)

A common choice of loss function in regression problems is the squared loss given
by L(t, y(x)) = {y(x) − t}2. In this case, the expected loss can be written

E[L] =

{y(x) − t}2p(x, t) dx dt.

(1.87)

(cid:6)(cid:6)

Our goal is to choose y(x) so as to minimize E[L].
If we assume a completely
ﬂexible function y(x), we can do this formally using the calculus of variations to
give

(cid:6)

{y(x) − t}p(x, t) dt = 0.

(1.88)

Solving for y(x), and using the sum and product rules of probability, we obtain

which is the conditional average of t conditioned on x and is known as the regression
function. This result is illustrated in Figure 1.28. It can readily be extended to mul-
tiple target variables represented by the vector t, in which case the optimal solution
is the conditional average y(x) = Et[t|x].

Exercise 1.25

We can also derive this result in a slightly different way, which will also shed
light on the nature of the regression problem. Armed with the knowledge that the
optimal solution is the conditional expectation, we can expand the square term as
follows

{y(x) − t}2 = {y(x) − E[t|x] + E[t|x] − t}2
= {y(x) − E[t|x]}2 + 2{y(x) − E[t|x]}{E[t|x] − t} + {E[t|x] − t}2

where, to keep the notation uncluttered, we use E[t|x] to denote Et[t|x]. Substituting
into the loss function and performing the integral over t, we see that the cross-term
vanishes and we obtain an expression for the loss function in the form
{E[t|x] − t}2p(x) dx.

{y(x) − E[t|x]}2

p(x) dx +

(1.90)

(cid:6)

E[L] =

(cid:6)

The function y(x) we seek to determine enters only in the ﬁrst term, which will be
minimized when y(x) is equal to E[t|x], in which case this term will vanish. This
is simply the result that we derived previously and that shows that the optimal least
squares predictor is given by the conditional mean. The second term is the variance
of the distribution of t, averaged over x.
It represents the intrinsic variability of
the target data and can be regarded as noise. Because it is independent of y(x), it
represents the irreducible minimum value of the loss function.

As with the classiﬁcation problem, we can either determine the appropriate prob-
abilities and then use these to make optimal decisions, or we can build models that
make decisions directly. Indeed, we can identify three distinct approaches to solving
regression problems given, in order of decreasing complexity, by:
(a) First solve the inference problem of determining the joint density p(x, t). Then
normalize to ﬁnd the conditional density p(t|x), and ﬁnally marginalize to ﬁnd
the conditional mean given by (1.89).

48

1. INTRODUCTION

(b) First solve the inference problem of determining the conditional density p(t|x),
and then subsequently marginalize to ﬁnd the conditional mean given by (1.89).

(c) Find a regression function y(x) directly from the training data.
The relative merits of these three approaches follow the same lines as for classiﬁca-
tion problems above.

The squared loss is not the only possible choice of loss function for regression.
Indeed, there are situations in which squared loss can lead to very poor results and
where we need to develop more sophisticated approaches. An important example
concerns situations in which the conditional distribution p(t|x) is multimodal, as
often arises in the solution of inverse problems. Here we consider brieﬂy one simple
generalization of the squared loss, called the Minkowski loss, whose expectation is
given by

(cid:6)(cid:6)

|y(x) − t|qp(x, t) dx dt

E[Lq] =

(1.91)
which reduces to the expected squared loss for q = 2. The function |y − t|q is
plotted against y − t for various values of q in Figure 1.29. The minimum of E[Lq]
is given by the conditional mean for q = 2, the conditional median for q = 1, and
the conditional mode for q → 0.

Information Theory

In this chapter, we have discussed a variety of concepts from probability theory and
decision theory that will form the foundations for much of the subsequent discussion
in this book. We close this chapter by introducing some additional concepts from
the ﬁeld of information theory, which will also prove useful in our development of
pattern recognition and machine learning techniques. Again, we shall focus only on
the key concepts, and we refer the reader elsewhere for more detailed discussions
(Viterbi and Omura, 1979; Cover and Thomas, 1991; MacKay, 2003) .

We begin by considering a discrete random variable x and we ask how much
information is received when we observe a speciﬁc value for this variable. The
amount of information can be viewed as the ‘degree of surprise’ on learning the
value of x. If we are told that a highly improbable event has just occurred, we will
have received more information than if we were told that some very likely event
has just occurred, and if we knew that the event was certain to happen we would
receive no information. Our measure of information content will therefore depend
on the probability distribution p(x), and we therefore look for a quantity h(x) that
is a monotonic function of the probability p(x) and that expresses the information
content. The form of h(·) can be found by noting that if we have two events x
and y that are unrelated, then the information gain from observing both of them
should be the sum of the information gained from each of them separately, so that
h(x, y) = h(x) + h(y). Two unrelated events will be statistically independent and
so p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). From these two relationships, it is easily shown that h(x)
must be given by the logarithm of p(x) and so we have

where the negative sign ensures that information is positive or zero. Note that low
probability events x correspond to high information content. The choice of basis
for the logarithm is arbitrary, and for the moment we shall adopt the convention
prevalent in information theory of using logarithms to the base of 2. In this case, as
we shall see shortly, the units of h(x) are bits (‘binary digits’).

Now suppose that a sender wishes to transmit the value of a random variable to
a receiver. The average amount of information that they transmit in the process is
obtained by taking the expectation of (1.92) with respect to the distribution p(x) and
is given by

(cid:2)

H[x] = −

p(x) log2 p(x).

(1.93)

x

This important quantity is called the entropy of the random variable x. Note that
limp→0 p ln p = 0 and so we shall take p(x) ln p(x) = 0 whenever we encounter a
value for x such that p(x) = 0.

So far we have given a rather heuristic motivation for the deﬁnition of informa-

tion (1.92) and the corresponding entropy (1.93). We now show that these deﬁnitions
indeed possess useful properties. Consider a random variable x having 8 possible
states, each of which is equally likely. In order to communicate the value of x to
a receiver, we would need to transmit a message of length 3 bits. Notice that the
entropy of this variable is given by

We see that the nonuniform distribution has a smaller entropy than the uniform one,
and we shall gain some insight into this shortly when we discuss the interpretation of
entropy in terms of disorder. For the moment, let us consider how we would transmit
the identity of the variable’s state to a receiver. We could do this, as before, using
a 3-bit number. However, we can take advantage of the nonuniform distribution by
using shorter codes for the more probable events, at the expense of longer codes for
the less probable events, in the hope of getting a shorter average code length. This
can be done by representing the states {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h} using, for instance, the
following set of code strings: 0, 10, 110, 1110, 111100, 111101, 111110, 111111.
The average length of the code that has to be transmitted is then

average code length =

× 4 + 4 × 1

× 6 = 2 bits

which again is the same as the entropy of the random variable. Note that shorter code
strings cannot be used because it must be possible to disambiguate a concatenation
of such strings into its component parts. For instance, 11001110 decodes uniquely
into the state sequence c, a, d.

This relation between entropy and shortest coding length is a general one. The
noiseless coding theorem (Shannon, 1948) states that the entropy is a lower bound
on the number of bits needed to transmit the state of a random variable.

From now on, we shall switch to the use of natural logarithms in deﬁning en-
tropy, as this will provide a more convenient link with ideas elsewhere in this book.
In this case, the entropy is measured in units of ‘nats’ instead of bits, which differ
simply by a factor of ln 2.

We have introduced the concept of entropy in terms of the average amount of
information needed to specify the state of a random variable. In fact, the concept of
entropy has much earlier origins in physics where it was introduced in the context
of equilibrium thermodynamics and later given a deeper interpretation as a measure
of disorder through developments in statistical mechanics. We can understand this
alternative view of entropy by considering a set of N identical objects that are to be
divided amongst a set of bins, such that there are ni objects in the ith bin. Consider

1.6. Information Theory

51

the number of different ways of allocating the objects to the bins. There are N
ways to choose the ﬁrst object, (N − 1) ways to choose the second object, and
so on, leading to a total of N! ways to allocate all N objects to the bins, where N!
(pronounced ‘factorial N’) denotes the product N ×(N −1)×···×2×1. However,
we don’t wish to distinguish between rearrangements of objects within each bin. In
the ith bin there are ni! ways of reordering the objects, and so the total number of
ways of allocating the N objects to the bins is given by

W = N!(cid:21)

i ni!

(1.94)

which is called the multiplicity. The entropy is then deﬁned as the logarithm of the
multiplicity scaled by an appropriate constant

H =

ln W =

of an object being assigned to the ith bin. In physics terminology, the speciﬁc ar-
rangements of objects in the bins is called a microstate, and the overall distribution
of occupation numbers, expressed through the ratios ni/N, is called a macrostate.
The multiplicity W is also known as the weight of the macrostate.

We can interpret the bins as the states xi of a discrete random variable X, where

p(X = xi) = pi. The entropy of the random variable X is then

H[p] = −

p(xi) ln p(xi).

Distributions p(xi) that are sharply peaked around a few values will have a relatively
low entropy, whereas those that are spread more evenly across many values will
have higher entropy, as illustrated in Figure 1.30. Because 0 (cid:1) pi (cid:1) 1, the entropy
is nonnegative, and it will equal its minimum value of 0 when one of the pi =
1 and all other pj(cid:4)=i = 0. The maximum entropy conﬁguration can be found by
maximizing H using a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the normalization constraint
on the probabilities. Thus we maximize

Exercise 1.29

from which we ﬁnd that all of the p(xi) are equal and are given by p(xi) = 1/M
where M is the total number of states xi. The corresponding value of the entropy
is then H = ln M. This result can also be derived from Jensen’s inequality (to be
discussed shortly). To verify that the stationary point is indeed a maximum, we can
evaluate the second derivative of the entropy, which gives

∂(cid:4)H

∂p(xi)∂p(xj)

= −Iij

(1.100)

where Iij are the elements of the identity matrix.

We can extend the deﬁnition of entropy to include distributions p(x) over con-
tinuous variables x as follows. First divide x into bins of width ∆. Then, assuming
p(x) is continuous, the mean value theorem (Weisstein, 1999) tells us that, for each
such bin, there must exist a value xi such that

(cid:6) (i+1)∆

p(x) dx = p(xi)∆.

(1.101)

i∆

We can now quantize the continuous variable x by assigning any value x to the value
xi whenever x falls in the ith bin. The probability of observing the value xi is then
p(xi)∆. This gives a discrete distribution for which the entropy takes the form

H∆ = −

1.6. Information Theory

∆ → 0. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (1.102) will approach the integral of
p(x) ln p(x) in this limit so that

∆→0

p(xi)∆ ln p(xi)

= −

p(x) ln p(x) dx

(1.103)

where the quantity on the right-hand side is called the differential entropy. We see
that the discrete and continuous forms of the entropy differ by a quantity ln ∆, which
diverges in the limit ∆ → 0. This reﬂects the fact that to specify a continuous
variable very precisely requires a large number of bits. For a density deﬁned over
multiple continuous variables, denoted collectively by the vector x, the differential
entropy is given by

(cid:6)

H[x] = −

p(x) ln p(x) dx.

(1.104)

In the case of discrete distributions, we saw that the maximum entropy con-
ﬁguration corresponded to an equal distribution of probabilities across the possible
states of the variable. Let us now consider the maximum entropy conﬁguration for
a continuous variable. In order for this maximum to be well deﬁned, it will be nec-
essary to constrain the ﬁrst and second moments of p(x) as well as preserving the
normalization constraint. We therefore maximize the differential entropy with the

Ludwig Boltzmann
1844–1906

Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann was an
Austrian physicist who created the
ﬁeld of statistical mechanics. Prior
to Boltzmann,
the concept of en-
tropy was already known from
classical thermodynamics where it
quantiﬁes the fact that when we take energy from a
system, not all of that energy is typically available
to do useful work. Boltzmann showed that the ther-
modynamic entropy S, a macroscopic quantity, could
be related to the statistical properties at the micro-
scopic level. This is expressed through the famous
equation S = k ln W in which W represents the
number of possible microstates in a macrostate, and
k (cid:3) 1.38 × 10−23 (in units of Joules per Kelvin) is
known as Boltzmann’s constant. Boltzmann’s ideas
were disputed by many scientists of they day. One dif-
ﬁculty they saw arose from the second law of thermo-

dynamics, which states that the entropy of a closed
system tends to increase with time. By contrast, at
the microscopic level the classical Newtonian equa-
tions of physics are reversible, and so they found it
difﬁcult to see how the latter could explain the for-
mer. They didn’t fully appreciate Boltzmann’s argu-
ments, which were statistical in nature and which con-
cluded not that entropy could never decrease over
time but simply that with overwhelming probability it
would generally increase. Boltzmann even had a long-
running dispute with the editor of the leading German
physics journal who refused to let him refer to atoms
and molecules as anything other than convenient the-
oretical constructs. The continued attacks on his work
lead to bouts of depression, and eventually he com-
mitted suicide. Shortly after Boltzmann’s death, new
experiments by Perrin on colloidal suspensions veri-
ﬁed his theories and conﬁrmed the value of the Boltz-
mann constant. The equation S = k ln W is carved on
Boltzmann’s tombstone.

The Lagrange multipliers can be found by back substitution of this result into the
three constraint equations, leading ﬁnally to the result

p(x) =

(1.109)

and so the distribution that maximizes the differential entropy is the Gaussian. Note
that we did not constrain the distribution to be nonnegative when we maximized the
entropy. However, because the resulting distribution is indeed nonnegative, we see
with hindsight that such a constraint is not necessary.

If we evaluate the differential entropy of the Gaussian, we obtain

(cid:26)

H[x] =

(cid:27)

1 + ln(2πσ2)

.

(1.110)

Thus we see again that the entropy increases as the distribution becomes broader,
i.e., as σ2 increases. This result also shows that the differential entropy, unlike the
discrete entropy, can be negative, because H(x) < 0 in (1.110) for σ2 < 1/(2πe).

Suppose we have a joint distribution p(x, y) from which we draw pairs of values
of x and y. If a value of x is already known, then the additional information needed
to specify the corresponding value of y is given by − ln p(y|x). Thus the average
additional information needed to specify y can be written as

(cid:6)(cid:6)

H[y|x] = −

p(y, x) ln p(y|x) dy dx

(1.111)

1.6. Information Theory

Exercise 1.37

which is called the conditional entropy of y given x. It is easily seen, using the
product rule, that the conditional entropy satisﬁes the relation

H[x, y] = H[y|x] + H[x]

(1.112)

where H[x, y] is the differential entropy of p(x, y) and H[x] is the differential en-
tropy of the marginal distribution p(x). Thus the information needed to describe x
and y is given by the sum of the information needed to describe x alone plus the
additional information required to specify y given x.

1.6.1 Relative entropy and mutual information
So far in this section, we have introduced a number of concepts from information
theory, including the key notion of entropy. We now start to relate these ideas to
pattern recognition. Consider some unknown distribution p(x), and suppose that
we have modelled this using an approximating distribution q(x). If we use q(x) to
construct a coding scheme for the purpose of transmitting values of x to a receiver,
then the average additional amount of information (in nats) required to specify the
value of x (assuming we choose an efﬁcient coding scheme) as a result of using q(x)
instead of the true distribution p(x) is given by
p(x) ln q(x) dx −

(1.113)

This is known as the relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, or KL diver-
gence (Kullback and Leibler, 1951), between the distributions p(x) and q(x). Note
that it is not a symmetrical quantity, that is to say KL(p(cid:6)q) (cid:2)≡ KL(q(cid:6)p).
We now show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence satisﬁes KL(p(cid:6)q) (cid:2) 0 with
equality if, and only if, p(x) = q(x). To do this we ﬁrst introduce the concept of
convex functions. A function f(x) is said to be convex if it has the property that
every chord lies on or above the function, as shown in Figure 1.31. Any value of x
in the interval from x = a to x = b can be written in the form λa + (1 − λ)b where
0 (cid:1) λ (cid:1) 1. The corresponding point on the chord is given by λf(a) + (1 − λ)f(b),

Claude Shannon
1916–2001

After graduating from Michigan and
MIT, Shannon joined the AT&T Bell
Telephone laboratories in 1941. His
paper ‘A Mathematical Theory of
Communication’ published in the
Bell System Technical Journal in
1948 laid the foundations for modern information the-

ory. This paper introduced the word ‘bit’, and his con-
cept that information could be sent as a stream of 1s
and 0s paved the way for the communications revo-
lution.
It is said that von Neumann recommended to
Shannon that he use the term entropy, not only be-
cause of its similarity to the quantity used in physics,
but also because “nobody knows what entropy really
is, so in any discussion you will always have an advan-
tage”.

and the corresponding value of the function is f (λa + (1 − λ)b). Convexity then
implies

(1.114)

Exercise 1.36

Exercise 1.38

This is equivalent to the requirement that the second derivative of the function be
everywhere positive. Examples of convex functions are x ln x (for x > 0) and x2. A
function is called strictly convex if the equality is satisﬁed only for λ = 0 and λ = 1.
If a function has the opposite property, namely that every chord lies on or below the
function, it is called concave, with a corresponding deﬁnition for strictly concave. If
a function f(x) is convex, then −f(x) will be concave.

Using the technique of proof by induction, we can show from (1.114) that a

where we have used the fact that − ln x is a convex function, together with the nor-
q(x) dx = 1. In fact, − ln x is a strictly convex function,
malization condition
so the equality will hold if, and only if, q(x) = p(x) for all x. Thus we can in-
terpret the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a measure of the dissimilarity of the two
distributions p(x) and q(x).

We see that there is an intimate relationship between data compression and den-
sity estimation (i.e., the problem of modelling an unknown probability distribution)
because the most efﬁcient compression is achieved when we know the true distri-
bution. If we use a distribution that is different from the true one, then we must
necessarily have a less efﬁcient coding, and on average the additional information
that must be transmitted is (at least) equal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence be-
tween the two distributions.

Suppose that data is being generated from an unknown distribution p(x) that we
wish to model. We can try to approximate this distribution using some parametric
distribution q(x|θ), governed by a set of adjustable parameters θ, for example a
multivariate Gaussian. One way to determine θ is to minimize the Kullback-Leibler
divergence between p(x) and q(x|θ) with respect to θ. We cannot do this directly
because we don’t know p(x). Suppose, however, that we have observed a ﬁnite set
of training points xn, for n = 1, . . . , N, drawn from p(x). Then the expectation
with respect to p(x) can be approximated by a ﬁnite sum over these points, using
(1.35), so that

{− ln q(xn|θ) + ln p(xn)} .

(1.119)

KL(p(cid:6)q) (cid:8) N(cid:2)

n=1

The second term on the right-hand side of (1.119) is independent of θ, and the ﬁrst
term is the negative log likelihood function for θ under the distribution q(x|θ) eval-
uated using the training set. Thus we see that minimizing this Kullback-Leibler
divergence is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function.

Now consider the joint distribution between two sets of variables x and y given
by p(x, y). If the sets of variables are independent, then their joint distribution will
factorize into the product of their marginals p(x, y) = p(x)p(y). If the variables are
not independent, we can gain some idea of whether they are ‘close’ to being indepen-
dent by considering the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint distribution
and the product of the marginals, given by

(cid:6)(cid:6)

I[x, y] ≡ KL(p(x, y)(cid:6)p(x)p(y))

= −

p(x, y) ln

(cid:15)

(cid:16)

p(x)p(y)
p(x, y)

dx dy

(1.120)

which is called the mutual information between the variables x and y. From the
properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we see that I(x, y) (cid:2) 0 with equal-
ity if, and only if, x and y are independent. Using the sum and product rules of
probability, we see that the mutual information is related to the conditional entropy
through

I[x, y] = H[x] − H[x|y] = H[y] − H[y|x].

(1.121)

Exercise 1.41

1. INTRODUCTION

Thus we can view the mutual information as the reduction in the uncertainty about x
by virtue of being told the value of y (or vice versa). From a Bayesian perspective,
we can view p(x) as the prior distribution for x and p(x|y) as the posterior distribu-
tion after we have observed new data y. The mutual information therefore represents
the reduction in uncertainty about x as a consequence of the new observation y.

1.3 ((cid:1) (cid:1)) Suppose that we have three coloured boxes r (red), b (blue), and g (green).
Box r contains 3 apples, 4 oranges, and 3 limes, box b contains 1 apple, 1 orange,
and 0 limes, and box g contains 3 apples, 3 oranges, and 4 limes. If a box is chosen
at random with probabilities p(r) = 0.2, p(b) = 0.2, p(g) = 0.6, and a piece of
fruit is removed from the box (with equal probability of selecting any of the items in
the box), then what is the probability of selecting an apple? If we observe that the
selected fruit is in fact an orange, what is the probability that it came from the green
box?

1.4 ((cid:1) (cid:1)) www Consider a probability density px(x) deﬁned over a continuous vari-
able x, and suppose that we make a nonlinear change of variable using x = g(y),
so that the density transforms according to (1.27). By differentiating (1.27), show

that the location(cid:1)y of the maximum of the density in y is not in general related to the
location(cid:1)x of the maximum of the density over x by the simple functional relation
(cid:1)x = g((cid:1)y) as a consequence of the Jacobian factor. This shows that the maximum

of a probability density (in contrast to a simple function) is dependent on the choice
of variable. Verify that, in the case of a linear transformation, the location of the
maximum transforms in the same way as the variable itself.

functions are additive, so that h(x, y) = h(x) + h(y). In this exercise, we derive the
relation between h and p in the form of a function h(p). First show that h(p2) =

Probability
Distributions

In Chapter 1, we emphasized the central role played by probability theory in the
solution of pattern recognition problems. We turn now to an exploration of some
particular examples of probability distributions and their properties. As well as be-
ing of great interest in their own right, these distributions can form building blocks
for more complex models and will be used extensively throughout the book. The
distributions introduced in this chapter will also serve another important purpose,
namely to provide us with the opportunity to discuss some key statistical concepts,
such as Bayesian inference, in the context of simple models before we encounter
them in more complex situations in later chapters.

One role for the distributions discussed in this chapter is to model the prob-
ability distribution p(x) of a random variable x, given a ﬁnite set x1, . . . , xN of
observations. This problem is known as density estimation. For the purposes of
this chapter, we shall assume that the data points are independent and identically
distributed. It should be emphasized that the problem of density estimation is fun-

67

68

2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

damentally ill-posed, because there are inﬁnitely many probability distributions that
could have given rise to the observed ﬁnite data set. Indeed, any distribution p(x)
that is nonzero at each of the data points x1, . . . , xN is a potential candidate. The
issue of choosing an appropriate distribution relates to the problem of model selec-
tion that has already been encountered in the context of polynomial curve ﬁtting in
Chapter 1 and that is a central issue in pattern recognition.

We begin by considering the binomial and multinomial distributions for discrete
random variables and the Gaussian distribution for continuous random variables.
These are speciﬁc examples of parametric distributions, so-called because they are
governed by a small number of adaptive parameters, such as the mean and variance in
the case of a Gaussian for example. To apply such models to the problem of density
estimation, we need a procedure for determining suitable values for the parameters,
given an observed data set. In a frequentist treatment, we choose speciﬁc values
for the parameters by optimizing some criterion, such as the likelihood function. By
contrast, in a Bayesian treatment we introduce prior distributions over the parameters
and then use Bayes’ theorem to compute the corresponding posterior distribution
given the observed data.

We shall see that an important role is played by conjugate priors, that lead to
posterior distributions having the same functional form as the prior, and that there-
fore lead to a greatly simpliﬁed Bayesian analysis. For example, the conjugate prior
for the parameters of the multinomial distribution is called the Dirichlet distribution,
while the conjugate prior for the mean of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. All of these
distributions are examples of the exponential family of distributions, which possess
a number of important properties, and which will be discussed in some detail.

One limitation of the parametric approach is that it assumes a speciﬁc functional
form for the distribution, which may turn out to be inappropriate for a particular
application. An alternative approach is given by nonparametric density estimation
methods in which the form of the distribution typically depends on the size of the data
set. Such models still contain parameters, but these control the model complexity
rather than the form of the distribution. We end this chapter by considering three
nonparametric methods based respectively on histograms, nearest-neighbours, and
kernels.

2.1. Binary Variables

We begin by considering a single binary random variable x ∈ {0, 1}. For example,
x might describe the outcome of ﬂipping a coin, with x = 1 representing ‘heads’,
and x = 0 representing ‘tails’. We can imagine that this is a damaged coin so that
the probability of landing heads is not necessarily the same as that of landing tails.
The probability of x = 1 will be denoted by the parameter µ so that

p(x = 1|µ) = µ

(2.1)

2.1. Binary Variables

where 0 (cid:1) µ (cid:1) 1, from which it follows that p(x = 0|µ) = 1 − µ. The probability
distribution over x can therefore be written in the form
Bern(x|µ) = µx(1 − µ)1−x

(2.2)

Exercise 2.1

which is known as the Bernoulli distribution. It is easily veriﬁed that this distribution
is normalized and that it has mean and variance given by

E[x] = µ
var[x] = µ(1 − µ).

(2.3)
(2.4)
Now suppose we have a data set D = {x1, . . . , xN} of observed values of x.
We can construct the likelihood function, which is a function of µ, on the assumption
that the observations are drawn independently from p(x|µ), so that

p(D|µ) =

p(xn|µ) =

µxn(1 − µ)1−xn.

n=1

In a frequentist setting, we can estimate a value for µ by maximizing the likelihood
function, or equivalently by maximizing the logarithm of the likelihood. In the case
of the Bernoulli distribution, the log likelihood function is given by

ln p(D|µ) =

ln p(xn|µ) =

{xn ln µ + (1 − xn) ln(1 − µ)} .

At this point, it is worth noting that the log likelihood function depends on the N
observations xn only through their sum
n xn. This sum provides an example of a
sufﬁcient statistic for the data under this distribution, and we shall study the impor-
tant role of sufﬁcient statistics in some detail. If we set the derivative of ln p(D|µ)
with respect to µ equal to zero, we obtain the maximum likelihood estimator

Jacob Bernoulli
1654–1705

Jacob Bernoulli, also known as
Jacques or James Bernoulli, was a
Swiss mathematician and was the
ﬁrst of many in the Bernoulli family
to pursue a career in science and
mathematics. Although compelled
to study philosophy and theology against his will by
his parents, he travelled extensively after graduating
in order to meet with many of the leading scientists of

his time, including Boyle and Hooke in England. When
he returned to Switzerland, he taught mechanics and
became Professor of Mathematics at Basel in 1687.
Unfortunately, rivalry between Jacob and his younger
brother Johann turned an initially productive collabora-
tion into a bitter and public dispute. Jacob’s most sig-
niﬁcant contributions to mathematics appeared in The
ArtofConjecture published in 1713, eight years after
his death, which deals with topics in probability the-
ory including what has become known as the Bernoulli
distribution.

which is also known as the sample mean. If we denote the number of observations
of x = 1 (heads) within this data set by m, then we can write (2.7) in the form

µML = m
N

(2.8)

so that the probability of landing heads is given, in this maximum likelihood frame-
work, by the fraction of observations of heads in the data set.

Now suppose we ﬂip a coin, say, 3 times and happen to observe 3 heads. Then
N = m = 3 and µML = 1. In this case, the maximum likelihood result would
predict that all future observations should give heads. Common sense tells us that
this is unreasonable, and in fact this is an extreme example of the over-ﬁtting associ-
ated with maximum likelihood. We shall see shortly how to arrive at more sensible
conclusions through the introduction of a prior distribution over µ.

We can also work out the distribution of the number m of observations of x = 1,
given that the data set has size N. This is called the binomial distribution, and
from (2.5) we see that it is proportional to µm(1 − µ)N−m. In order to obtain the
normalization coefﬁcient we note that out of N coin ﬂips, we have to add up all
of the possible ways of obtaining m heads, so that the binomial distribution can be
written

is the number of ways of choosing m objects out of a total of N identical objects.
Figure 2.1 shows a plot of the binomial distribution for N = 10 and µ = 0.25.

The mean and variance of the binomial distribution can be found by using the
result of Exercise 1.10, which shows that for independent events the mean of the
sum is the sum of the means, and the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.
Because m = x1 + . . . + xN , and for each observation the mean and variance are

2.1.1 The beta distribution
We have seen in (2.8) that the maximum likelihood setting for the parameter µ
in the Bernoulli distribution, and hence in the binomial distribution, is given by the
fraction of the observations in the data set having x = 1. As we have already noted,
this can give severely over-ﬁtted results for small data sets. In order to develop a
Bayesian treatment for this problem, we need to introduce a prior distribution p(µ)
over the parameter µ. Here we consider a form of prior distribution that has a simple
interpretation as well as some useful analytical properties. To motivate this prior,
we note that the likelihood function takes the form of the product of factors of the
form µx(1 − µ)1−x. If we choose a prior to be proportional to powers of µ and
(1 − µ), then the posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product of the
prior and the likelihood function, will have the same functional form as the prior.
This property is called conjugacy and we will see several examples of it later in this
chapter. We therefore choose a prior, called the beta distribution, given by

Exercise 2.5

Beta(µ|a, b) =

Γ(a + b)

Γ(a)Γ(b) µa−1(1 − µ)b−1

(2.13)

where Γ(x) is the gamma function deﬁned by (1.141), and the coefﬁcient in (2.13)
ensures that the beta distribution is normalized, so that
Beta(µ|a, b) dµ = 1.

(2.16)

The parameters a and b are often called hyperparameters because they control the
distribution of the parameter µ. Figure 2.2 shows plots of the beta distribution for
various values of the hyperparameters.

The posterior distribution of µ is now obtained by multiplying the beta prior
(2.13) by the binomial likelihood function (2.9) and normalizing. Keeping only the
factors that depend on µ, we see that this posterior distribution has the form

p(µ|m, l, a, b) ∝ µm+a−1(1 − µ)l+b−1

where l = N − m, and therefore corresponds to the number of ‘tails’ in the coin
example. We see that (2.17) has the same functional dependence on µ as the prior
distribution, reﬂecting the conjugacy properties of the prior with respect to the like-
lihood function. Indeed, it is simply another beta distribution, and its normalization
coefﬁcient can therefore be obtained by comparison with (2.13) to give

p(µ|m, l, a, b) =

Γ(m + a + l + b)

Γ(m + a)Γ(l + b) µm+a−1(1 − µ)l+b−1.

(2.18)

We see that the effect of observing a data set of m observations of x = 1 and
l observations of x = 0 has been to increase the value of a by m, and the value of
b by l, in going from the prior distribution to the posterior distribution. This allows
us to provide a simple interpretation of the hyperparameters a and b in the prior as
an effective number of observations of x = 1 and x = 0, respectively. Note that
a and b need not be integers. Furthermore, the posterior distribution can act as the
prior if we subsequently observe additional data. To see this, we can imagine taking
observations one at a time and after each observation updating the current posterior

Figure 2.3 Illustration of one step of sequential Bayesian inference. The prior is given by a beta distribution
with parameters a = 2, b = 2, and the likelihood function, given by (2.9) with N = m = 1, corresponds to a

distribution by multiplying by the likelihood function for the new observation and
then normalizing to obtain the new, revised posterior distribution. At each stage, the
posterior is a beta distribution with some total number of (prior and actual) observed
values for x = 1 and x = 0 given by the parameters a and b. Incorporation of an
additional observation of x = 1 simply corresponds to incrementing the value of a
by 1, whereas for an observation of x = 0 we increment b by 1. Figure 2.3 illustrates
one step in this process.

Section 2.3.5

We see that this sequential approach to learning arises naturally when we adopt
a Bayesian viewpoint. It is independent of the choice of prior and of the likelihood
function and depends only on the assumption of i.i.d. data. Sequential methods make
use of observations one at a time, or in small batches, and then discard them before
the next observations are used. They can be used, for example, in real-time learning
scenarios where a steady stream of data is arriving, and predictions must be made
before all of the data is seen. Because they do not require the whole data set to be
stored or loaded into memory, sequential methods are also useful for large data sets.
Maximum likelihood methods can also be cast into a sequential framework.
If our goal is to predict, as best we can, the outcome of the next trial, then we
must evaluate the predictive distribution of x, given the observed data set D. From
the sum and product rules of probability, this takes the form

p(x = 1|D) =

p(x = 1|µ)p(µ|D) dµ =

µp(µ|D) dµ = E[µ|D].

(cid:6) 1

(cid:6) 1

(2.19)
Using the result (2.18) for the posterior distribution p(µ|D), together with the result
(2.15) for the mean of the beta distribution, we obtain
m + a

p(x = 1|D) =

(2.20)

m + a + l + b

which has a simple interpretation as the total fraction of observations (both real ob-
servations and ﬁctitious prior observations) that correspond to x = 1. Note that in
the limit of an inﬁnitely large data set m, l → ∞ the result (2.20) reduces to the
maximum likelihood result (2.8). As we shall see, it is a very general property that
the Bayesian and maximum likelihood results will agree in the limit of an inﬁnitely

74

large data set. For a ﬁnite data set, the posterior mean for µ always lies between the
prior mean and the maximum likelihood estimate for µ corresponding to the relative
frequencies of events given by (2.7).

From Figure 2.2, we see that as the number of observations increases, so the
posterior distribution becomes more sharply peaked. This can also be seen from
the result (2.16) for the variance of the beta distribution, in which we see that the
variance goes to zero for a → ∞ or b → ∞. In fact, we might wonder whether it is
a general property of Bayesian learning that, as we observe more and more data, the
uncertainty represented by the posterior distribution will steadily decrease.

To address this, we can take a frequentist view of Bayesian learning and show
that, on average, such a property does indeed hold. Consider a general Bayesian
inference problem for a parameter θ for which we have observed a data set D, de-
scribed by the joint distribution p(θ,D). The following result

where

Eθ[θ] ≡
ED[Eθ[θ|D]] ≡

(2.22)

(cid:13)

θp(θ|D) dθ

Eθ[θ] = ED [Eθ[θ|D]]

(cid:6)
(cid:6) (cid:12)(cid:6)

p(θ)θ dθ

says that the posterior mean of θ, averaged over the distribution generating the data,
is equal to the prior mean of θ. Similarly, we can show that

varθ[θ] = ED [varθ[θ|D]] + varD [Eθ[θ|D]] .

(2.24)

The term on the left-hand side of (2.24) is the prior variance of θ. On the right-
hand side, the ﬁrst term is the average posterior variance of θ, and the second term
measures the variance in the posterior mean of θ. Because this variance is a positive
quantity, this result shows that, on average, the posterior variance of θ is smaller than
the prior variance. The reduction in variance is greater if the variance in the posterior
mean is greater. Note, however, that this result only holds on average, and that for a
particular observed data set it is possible for the posterior variance to be larger than
the prior variance.

2.2. Multinomial Variables

Binary variables can be used to describe quantities that can take one of two possible
values. Often, however, we encounter discrete variables that can take on one of K
possible mutually exclusive states. Although there are various alternative ways to
express such variables, we shall see shortly that a particularly convenient represen-
tation is the 1-of-K scheme in which the variable is represented by a K-dimensional
vector x in which one of the elements xk equals 1, and all remaining elements equal

will be represented by

Note that such vectors satisfy

and
regarded as a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution to more than two outcomes.
It is easily seen that the distribution is normalized

(2.27)

and that

E[x|µ] =

Now consider a data set D of N independent observations x1, . . . , xN . The

In order to ﬁnd the maximum likelihood solution for µ, we need to maximize
ln p(D|µ) with respect to µk taking account of the constraint that the µk must sum
to one. This can be achieved using a Lagrange multiplier λ and maximizing

2.2.1 The Dirichlet distribution

distribution, we see that the conjugate prior is given by

k µk = 1. Here α1, . . . , αK are the parameters of the
distribution, and α denotes (α1, . . . , αK)T. Note that, because of the summation
constraint, the distribution over the space of the {µk} is conﬁned to a simplex of
dimensionality K − 1, as illustrated for K = 3 in Figure 2.4.

Dirichlet was a modest and re-

contributions in number theory, me-
chanics, and astronomy, and who
gave the ﬁrst rigorous analysis of
Fourier series. His family originated from Richelet
in Belgium, and the name Lejeune Dirichlet comes

from ‘le jeune de Richelet’ (the young person from
Richelet). Dirichlet’s ﬁrst paper, which was published
in 1825, brought him instant fame. It concerned Fer-
mat’s last theorem, which claims that there are no
positive integer solutions to xn + yn = zn for n > 2.
Dirichlet gave a partial proof for the case n = 5, which
was sent to Legendre for review and who in turn com-
pleted the proof. Later, Dirichlet gave a complete proof
for n = 14, although a full proof of Fermat’s last theo-
rem for arbitrary n had to wait until the work of Andrew
Wiles in the closing years of the 20th century.

distribution can be written in the form

The Gaussian distribution arises in many different contexts and can be motivated
from a variety of different perspectives. For example, we have already seen that for
a single real variable, the distribution that maximizes the entropy is the Gaussian.
This property applies also to the multivariate Gaussian.

Another situation in which the Gaussian distribution arises is when we consider
the sum of multiple random variables. The central limit theorem (due to Laplace)
tells us that, subject to certain mild conditions, the sum of a set of random variables,
which is of course itself a random variable, has a distribution that becomes increas-
ingly Gaussian as the number of terms in the sum increases (Walker, 1969). We can

very rapid. One consequence of this result is that the binomial distribution (2.9),
which is a distribution over m deﬁned by the sum of N observations of the random
binary variable x, will tend to a Gaussian as N → ∞ (see Figure 2.1 for the case of
N = 10).

The Gaussian distribution has many important analytical properties, and we shall
consider several of these in detail. As a result, this section will be rather more tech-
nically involved than some of the earlier sections, and will require familiarity with
various matrix identities. However, we strongly encourage the reader to become pro-
ﬁcient in manipulating Gaussian distributions using the techniques presented here as
this will prove invaluable in understanding the more complex models presented in
later chapters.

We begin by considering the geometrical form of the Gaussian distribution. The

Appendix C

Carl Friedrich Gauss
1777–1855

It
is said that when Gauss went
to elementary school at age 7, his
teacher B¨uttner, trying to keep the
class occupied, asked the pupils to
sum the integers from 1 to 100. To
the teacher’s amazement, Gauss
arrived at the answer in a matter of moments by noting
that the sum can be represented as 50 pairs (1 + 100,
2+99, etc.) each of which added to 101, giving the an-
swer 5,050. It is now believed that the problem which
was actually set was of the same form but somewhat
harder in that the sequence had a larger starting value
and a larger increment. Gauss was a German math-

ematician and scientist with a reputation for being a
hard-working perfectionist. One of his many contribu-
tions was to show that least squares can be derived
under the assumption of normally distributed errors.
He also created an early formulation of non-Euclidean
geometry (a self-consistent geometrical theory that vi-
olates the axioms of Euclid) but was reluctant to dis-
cuss it openly for fear that his reputation might suffer
if it were seen that he believed in such a geometry.
At one point, Gauss was asked to conduct a geodetic
survey of the state of Hanover, which led to his for-
mulation of the normal distribution, now also known
as the Gaussian. After his death, a study of his di-
aries revealed that he had discovered several impor-
tant mathematical results years or even decades be-
fore they were published by others.

functional dependence of the Gaussian on x is through the quadratic form

∆2 = (x − µ)TΣ

−1(x − µ)

(2.44)

which appears in the exponent. The quantity ∆ is called the Mahalanobis distance
from µ to x and reduces to the Euclidean distance when Σ is the identity matrix. The
Gaussian distribution will be constant on surfaces in x-space for which this quadratic
form is constant.

First of all, we note that the matrix Σ can be taken to be symmetric, without
loss of generality, because any antisymmetric component would disappear from the
exponent. Now consider the eigenvector equation for the covariance matrix

where U is a matrix whose rows are given by uT

an orthogonal matrix, i.e., it satisﬁes UUT = I, and hence also UTU = I, where I
is the identity matrix.

For the Gaussian distribution to be well deﬁned, it is necessary for all of the
eigenvalues λi of the covariance matrix to be strictly positive, otherwise the dis-
tribution cannot be properly normalized. A matrix whose eigenvalues are strictly
positive is said to be positive deﬁnite. In Chapter 12, we will encounter Gaussian
distributions for which one or more of the eigenvalues are zero, in which case the
distribution is singular and is conﬁned to a subspace of lower dimensionality. If all
of the eigenvalues are nonnegative, then the covariance matrix is said to be positive
semideﬁnite.

Now consider the form of the Gaussian distribution in the new coordinate system
deﬁned by the yi. In going from the x to the y coordinate system, we have a Jacobian
matrix J with elements given by

Jij = ∂xi
∂yj

= Uji

(2.53)

where Uji are the elements of the matrix UT. Using the orthonormality property of
the matrix U, we see that the square of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix is

(2.54)
and hence |J| = 1. Also, the determinant |Σ| of the covariance matrix can be written

(cid:7)(cid:7)UT

We now look at the moments of the Gaussian distribution and thereby provide an

distribution is given by

where we have changed variables using z = x − µ. We now note that the exponent
is an even function of the components of z and, because the integrals over these are
taken over the range (−∞,∞), the term in z in the factor (z + µ) will vanish by
symmetry. Thus

E[x] = µ

and so we refer to µ as the mean of the Gaussian distribution.

We now consider second order moments of the Gaussian. In the univariate case,
we considered the second order moment given by E[x2]. For the multivariate Gaus-
sian, there are D2 second order moments given by E[xixj], which we can group
together to form the matrix E[xxT]. This matrix can be written as

where again we have changed variables using z = x − µ. Note that the cross-terms

that the integral on the right-hand side of the middle line vanishes by symmetry
unless i = j, and in the ﬁnal line we have made use of the results (1.50) and (2.55),
together with (2.48). Thus we have

E[xxT] = µµT + Σ.

(2.62)

For single random variables, we subtracted the mean before taking second mo-
ments in order to deﬁne a variance. Similarly, in the multivariate case it is again
convenient to subtract off the mean, giving rise to the covariance of a random vector
x deﬁned by

cov[x] = E

(2.63)
For the speciﬁc case of a Gaussian distribution, we can make use of E[x] = µ,
together with the result (2.62), to give

(x − E[x])(x − E[x])T

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

.

cov[x] = Σ.

(2.64)

Because the parameter matrix Σ governs the covariance of x under the Gaussian
distribution, it is called the covariance matrix.

Although the Gaussian distribution (2.43) is widely used as a density model, it
suffers from some signiﬁcant limitations. Consider the number of free parameters in
the distribution. A general symmetric covariance matrix Σ will have D(D + 1)/2
independent parameters, and there are another D independent parameters in µ, giv-
ing D(D + 3)/2 parameters in total. For large D, the total number of parameters

therefore grows quadratically with D, and the computational task of manipulating
and inverting large matrices can become prohibitive. One way to address this prob-
lem is to use restricted forms of the covariance matrix. If we consider covariance
matrices that are diagonal, so that Σ = diag(σ2
i ), we then have a total of 2D inde-
pendent parameters in the density model. The corresponding contours of constant
density are given by axis-aligned ellipsoids. We could further restrict the covariance
matrix to be proportional to the identity matrix, Σ = σ2I, known as an isotropic co-
variance, giving D + 1 independent parameters in the model and spherical surfaces
of constant density. The three possibilities of general, diagonal, and isotropic covari-
ance matrices are illustrated in Figure 2.8. Unfortunately, whereas such approaches
limit the number of degrees of freedom in the distribution and make inversion of the
covariance matrix a much faster operation, they also greatly restrict the form of the
probability density and limit its ability to capture interesting correlations in the data.
A further limitation of the Gaussian distribution is that it is intrinsically uni-
modal (i.e., has a single maximum) and so is unable to provide a good approximation
to multimodal distributions. Thus the Gaussian distribution can be both too ﬂexible,
in the sense of having too many parameters, while also being too limited in the range
of distributions that it can adequately represent. We will see later that the introduc-
tion of latent variables, also called hidden variables or unobserved variables, allows
both of these problems to be addressed. In particular, a rich family of multimodal
distributions is obtained by introducing discrete latent variables leading to mixtures
of Gaussians, as discussed in Section 2.3.9. Similarly, the introduction of continuous
latent variables, as described in Chapter 12, leads to models in which the number of
free parameters can be controlled independently of the dimensionality D of the data
space while still allowing the model to capture the dominant correlations in the data
set. Indeed, these two approaches can be combined and further extended to derive
a very rich set of hierarchical models that can be adapted to a broad range of prac-
tical applications. For instance, the Gaussian version of the Markov random ﬁeld,
which is widely used as a probabilistic model of images, is a Gaussian distribution
over the joint space of pixel intensities but rendered tractable through the imposition
of considerable structure reﬂecting the spatial organization of the pixels. Similarly,
the linear dynamical system, used to model time series data for applications such
as tracking, is also a joint Gaussian distribution over a potentially large number of
observed and latent variables and again is tractable due to the structure imposed on
the distribution. A powerful framework for expressing the form and properties of

Section 8.3

Section 13.3

2.3. The Gaussian Distribution

85

such complex distributions is that of probabilistic graphical models, which will form
the subject of Chapter 8.

2.3.1 Conditional Gaussian distributions
An important property of the multivariate Gaussian distribution is that if two
sets of variables are jointly Gaussian, then the conditional distribution of one set
conditioned on the other is again Gaussian. Similarly, the marginal distribution of
either set is also Gaussian.
Consider ﬁrst the case of conditional distributions. Suppose x is a D-dimensional
vector with Gaussian distribution N (x|µ, Σ) and that we partition x into two dis-
joint subsets xa and xb. Without loss of generality, we can take xa to form the ﬁrst
M components of x, with xb comprising the remaining D − M components, so that

We also deﬁne corresponding partitions of the mean vector µ given by

and of the covariance matrix Σ given by

Note that the symmetry ΣT = Σ of the covariance matrix implies that Σaa and Σbb
are symmetric, while Σba = ΣT
ab.

In many situations, it will be convenient to work with the inverse of the covari-

ance matrix

Λ ≡ Σ

−1

(2.68)

which is known as the precision matrix. In fact, we shall see that some properties
of Gaussian distributions are most naturally expressed in terms of the covariance,
whereas others take a simpler form when viewed in terms of the precision. We
therefore also introduce the partitioned form of the precision matrix

(cid:15)

Λ =

Λaa Λab
Λba Λbb

Exercise 2.22

corresponding to the partitioning (2.65) of the vector x. Because the inverse of a
symmetric matrix is also symmetric, we see that Λaa and Λbb are symmetric, while
ΛT
ab = Λba. It should be stressed at this point that, for instance, Λaa is not simply
given by the inverse of Σaa. In fact, we shall shortly examine the relation between
the inverse of a partitioned matrix and the inverses of its partitions.
Let us begin by ﬁnding an expression for the conditional distribution p(xa|xb).
From the product rule of probability, we see that this conditional distribution can be

2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

evaluated from the joint distribution p(x) = p(xa, xb) simply by ﬁxing xb to the
observed value and normalizing the resulting expression to obtain a valid probability
distribution over xa.
Instead of performing this normalization explicitly, we can
obtain the solution more efﬁciently by considering the quadratic form in the exponent
of the Gaussian distribution given by (2.44) and then reinstating the normalization
coefﬁcient at the end of the calculation. If we make use of the partitioning (2.65),
(2.66), and (2.69), we obtain

(xb − µb)TΛba(xa − µa) − 1
2

(2.70)

We see that as a function of xa, this is again a quadratic form, and hence the cor-
responding conditional distribution p(xa|xb) will be Gaussian. Because this distri-
bution is completely characterized by its mean and its covariance, our goal will be
to identify expressions for the mean and covariance of p(xa|xb) by inspection of
(2.70).

This is an example of a rather common operation associated with Gaussian
distributions, sometimes called ‘completing the square’, in which we are given a
quadratic form deﬁning the exponent terms in a Gaussian distribution, and we need
to determine the corresponding mean and covariance. Such problems can be solved
straightforwardly by noting that the exponent in a general Gaussian distribution
N (x|µ, Σ) can be written

(x − µ)TΣ

−1(x − µ) = −1

xTΣ

−1x + xTΣ

−1µ + const

(2.71)

−1 and the coefﬁcient of the linear term in x to Σ

where ‘const’ denotes terms which are independent of x, and we have made use of
the symmetry of Σ. Thus if we take our general quadratic form and express it in
the form given by the right-hand side of (2.71), then we can immediately equate the
matrix of coefﬁcients entering the second order term in x to the inverse covariance
−1µ, from which we can
matrix Σ
obtain µ.
Now let us apply this procedure to the conditional Gaussian distribution p(xa|xb)
for which the quadratic form in the exponent is given by (2.70). We will denote the
mean and covariance of this distribution by µa|b and Σa|b, respectively. Consider
the functional dependence of (2.70) on xa in which xb is regarded as a constant. If
we pick out all terms that are second order in xa, we have

(2.72)

from which we can immediately conclude that the covariance (inverse precision) of
p(xa|xb) is given by

The results (2.73) and (2.75) are expressed in terms of the partitioned precision
matrix of the original joint distribution p(xa, xb). We can also express these results
in terms of the corresponding partitioned covariance matrix. To do this, we make use
of the following identity for the inverse of a partitioned matrix

Comparing (2.73) and (2.82), we see that the conditional distribution p(xa|xb) takes
a simpler form when expressed in terms of the partitioned precision matrix than
when it is expressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix. Note that the
mean of the conditional distribution p(xa|xb), given by (2.81), is a linear function of
xb and that the covariance, given by (2.82), is independent of xa. This represents an
example of a linear-Gaussian model.

2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

2.3.2 Marginal Gaussian distributions
We have seen that if a joint distribution p(xa, xb) is Gaussian, then the condi-
tional distribution p(xa|xb) will again be Gaussian. Now we turn to a discussion of
the marginal distribution given by

(cid:6)

p(xa) =

p(xa, xb) dxb

(2.83)

which, as we shall see, is also Gaussian. Once again, our strategy for evaluating this
distribution efﬁciently will be to focus on the quadratic form in the exponent of the
joint distribution and thereby to identify the mean and covariance of the marginal
distribution p(xa).

The quadratic form for the joint distribution can be expressed, using the par-
titioned precision matrix, in the form (2.70). Because our goal is to integrate out
xb, this is most easily achieved by ﬁrst considering the terms involving xb and then
completing the square in order to facilitate integration. Picking out just those terms
that involve xb, we have

where we have deﬁned

m = Λbbµb − Λba(xa − µa).

(2.85)

We see that the dependence on xb has been cast into the standard quadratic form of a
Gaussian distribution corresponding to the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (2.84),
plus a term that does not depend on xb (but that does depend on xa). Thus, when
we take the exponential of this quadratic form, we see that the integration over xb
required by (2.83) will take the form
(xb − Λ

(cid:6)

This integration is easily performed by noting that it is the integral over an unnor-
malized Gaussian, and so the result will be the reciprocal of the normalization co-
efﬁcient. We know from the form of the normalized Gaussian given by (2.43), that
this coefﬁcient is independent of the mean and depends only on the determinant of
the covariance matrix. Thus, by completing the square with respect to xb, we can
integrate out xb and the only term remaining from the contributions on the left-hand
side of (2.84) that depends on xa is the last term on the right-hand side of (2.84) in
which m is given by (2.85). Combining this term with the remaining terms from

2.3. The Gaussian Distribution

(2.70) that depend on xa, we obtain

where ‘const’ denotes quantities independent of xa. Again, by comparison with
(2.71), we see that the covariance of the marginal distribution of p(xa) is given by

Σa = (Λaa − ΛabΛ

−1
bb Λba)−1.

Similarly, the mean is given by

Σa(Λaa − ΛabΛ

−1
bb Λba)µa = µa

where we have used (2.88). The covariance in (2.88) is expressed in terms of the
partitioned precision matrix given by (2.69). We can rewrite this in terms of the
corresponding partitioning of the covariance matrix given by (2.67), as we did for
the conditional distribution. These partitioned matrices are related by

Making use of (2.76), we then have

(2.91)
Thus we obtain the intuitively satisfying result that the marginal distribution p(xa)
has mean and covariance given by

E[xa] = µa

cov[xa] = Σaa.

(2.92)
(2.93)

We see that for a marginal distribution, the mean and covariance are most simply ex-
pressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix, in contrast to the conditional
distribution for which the partitioned precision matrix gives rise to simpler expres-
sions.

Our results for the marginal and conditional distributions of a partitioned Gaus-

sian are summarized below.

We illustrate the idea of conditional and marginal distributions associated with

a multivariate Gaussian using an example involving two variables in Figure 2.9.

2.3.3 Bayes’ theorem for Gaussian variables
In Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, we considered a Gaussian p(x) in which we parti-
tioned the vector x into two subvectors x = (xa, xb) and then found expressions for
the conditional distribution p(xa|xb) and the marginal distribution p(xa). We noted
that the mean of the conditional distribution p(xa|xb) was a linear function of xb.
Here we shall suppose that we are given a Gaussian marginal distribution p(x) and a
Gaussian conditional distribution p(y|x) in which p(y|x) has a mean that is a linear
function of x, and a covariance which is independent of x. This is an example of

2.3. The Gaussian Distribution

91

a linear Gaussian model (Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999), which we shall study in
greater generality in Section 8.1.4. We wish to ﬁnd the marginal distribution p(y)
and the conditional distribution p(x|y). This is a problem that will arise frequently
in subsequent chapters, and it will prove convenient to derive the general results here.

We shall take the marginal and conditional distributions to be

p(x) = N(cid:10)
p(y|x) = N(cid:10)

(cid:11)

(cid:11)

−1

x|µ, Λ
y|Ax + b, L−1

where µ, A, and b are parameters governing the means, and Λ and L are precision
matrices. If x has dimensionality M and y has dimensionality D, then the matrix A
has size D × M.

First we ﬁnd an expression for the joint distribution over x and y. To do this, we

deﬁne

z =

(cid:15)

(cid:16)

x
y

(2.99)
(2.100)

(2.101)

and then consider the log of the joint distribution

ln p(z) = ln p(x) + ln p(y|x)

(x − µ)TΛ(x − µ)
(y − Ax − b)TL(y − Ax − b) + const

(2.102)

where ‘const’ denotes terms independent of x and y. As before, we see that this is a
quadratic function of the components of z, and hence p(z) is Gaussian distribution.
To ﬁnd the precision of this Gaussian, we consider the second order terms in (2.102),
which can be written as

Next we ﬁnd an expression for the marginal distribution p(y) in which we have
marginalized over x. Recall that the marginal distribution over a subset of the com-
ponents of a Gaussian random vector takes a particularly simple form when ex-
pressed in terms of the partitioned covariance matrix. Speciﬁcally, its mean and
covariance are given by (2.92) and (2.93), respectively. Making use of (2.105) and
(2.108) we see that the mean and covariance of the marginal distribution p(y) are
given by

E[y] = Aµ + b
cov[y] = L−1 + AΛ

−1AT.

(2.109)
(2.110)

A special case of this result is when A = I, in which case it reduces to the convolu-
tion of two Gaussians, for which we see that the mean of the convolution is the sum
of the mean of the two Gaussians, and the covariance of the convolution is the sum
of their covariances.
Finally, we seek an expression for the conditional p(x|y). Recall that the results
for the conditional distribution are most easily expressed in terms of the partitioned
precision matrix, using (2.73) and (2.75). Applying these results to (2.105) and
(2.108) we see that the conditional distribution p(x|y) has mean and covariance
given by

E[x|y] = (Λ + ATLA)−1
cov[x|y] = (Λ + ATLA)−1.

(cid:27)

The evaluation of this conditional can be seen as an example of Bayes’ theorem.
We can interpret the distribution p(x) as a prior distribution over x. If the variable
y is observed, then the conditional distribution p(x|y) represents the corresponding
posterior distribution over x. Having found the marginal and conditional distribu-
tions, we effectively expressed the joint distribution p(z) = p(x)p(y|x) in the form
p(x|y)p(y). These results are summarized below.

2.3.4 Maximum likelihood for the Gaussian
Given a data set X = (x1, . . . , xN )T in which the observations {xn} are as-
sumed to be drawn independently from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, we can
estimate the parameters of the distribution by maximum likelihood. The log likeli-
hood function is given by

(C.19), the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to µ is given by

(2.120)

and setting this derivative to zero, we obtain the solution for the maximum likelihood

Exercise 2.34

which is the mean of the observed set of data points. The maximization of (2.118)
with respect to Σ is rather more involved. The simplest approach is to ignore the
symmetry constraint and show that the resulting solution is symmetric as required.
Alternative derivations of this result, which impose the symmetry and positive deﬁ-
niteness constraints explicitly, can be found in Magnus and Neudecker (1999). The
result is as expected and takes the form

which involves µML because this is the result of a joint maximization with respect
to µ and Σ. Note that the solution (2.121) for µML does not depend on ΣML, and so
we can ﬁrst evaluate µML and then use this to evaluate ΣML.

If we evaluate the expectations of the maximum likelihood solutions under the

to the true mean. However, the maximum likelihood estimate for the covariance has
an expectation that is less than the true value, and hence it is biased. We can correct

2.3.5 Sequential estimation
Our discussion of the maximum likelihood solution for the parameters of a Gaus-
sian distribution provides a convenient opportunity to give a more general discussion
of the topic of sequential estimation for maximum likelihood. Sequential methods
allow data points to be processed one at a time and then discarded and are important
for on-line applications, and also where large data sets are involved so that batch
processing of all data points at once is infeasible.

Consider the result (2.121) for the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean
ML when it is based on N observations. If we

This result has a nice interpretation, as follows. After observing N − 1 data points
we have estimated µ by µ(N−1)

revised estimate µ(N )
ML by moving the old estimate a small amount, proportional to
1/N, in the direction of the ‘error signal’ (xN − µ(N−1)
). Note that, as N increases,
so the contribution from successive data points gets smaller.

The result (2.126) will clearly give the same answer as the batch result (2.121)
because the two formulae are equivalent. However, we will not always be able to de-
rive a sequential algorithm by this route, and so we seek a more general formulation
of sequential learning, which leads us to the Robbins-Monro algorithm. Consider a
pair of random variables θ and z governed by a joint distribution p(z, θ). The con-
ditional expectation of z given θ deﬁnes a deterministic function f(θ) that is given
by

(cid:6)

f(θ) ≡ E[z|θ] =

zp(z|θ) dz

(2.127)

and is illustrated schematically in Figure 2.10. Functions deﬁned in this way are
called regression functions.

Our goal is to ﬁnd the root θ(cid:1) at which f(θ(cid:1)) = 0. If we had a large data set
of observations of z and θ, then we could model the regression function directly and
then obtain an estimate of its root. Suppose, however, that we observe values of
z one at a time and we wish to ﬁnd a corresponding sequential estimation scheme
for θ(cid:1). The following general procedure for solving such problems was given by

(cid:9)

Robbins and Monro (1951). We shall assume that the conditional variance of z is
ﬁnite so that

(2.128)
and we shall also, without loss of generality, consider the case where f(θ) > 0 for
θ > θ(cid:1) and f(θ) < 0 for θ < θ(cid:1), as is the case in Figure 2.10. The Robbins-Monro
procedure then deﬁnes a sequence of successive estimates of the root θ(cid:1) given by

E

(z − f)2 | θ

< ∞

θ(N ) = θ(N−1) + aN−1z(θ(N−1))

(2.129)

where z(θ(N )) is an observed value of z when θ takes the value θ(N ). The coefﬁcients
{aN} represent a sequence of positive numbers that satisfy the conditions

N =1

N < ∞.

(2.130)

(2.131)

(2.132)

N =1

It can then be shown (Robbins and Monro, 1951; Fukunaga, 1990) that the sequence
of estimates given by (2.129) does indeed converge to the root with probability one.
Note that the ﬁrst condition (2.130) ensures that the successive corrections decrease
in magnitude so that the process can converge to a limiting value. The second con-
dition (2.131) is required to ensure that the algorithm does not converge short of the
root, and the third condition (2.132) is needed to ensure that the accumulated noise
has ﬁnite variance and hence does not spoil convergence.

Now let us consider how a general maximum likelihood problem can be solved
sequentially using the Robbins-Monro algorithm. By deﬁnition, the maximum like-
lihood solution θML is a stationary point of the log likelihood function and hence
satisﬁes

(cid:24)

and so we see that ﬁnding the maximum likelihood solution corresponds to ﬁnd-

θ(N ) = θ(N−1) + aN−1

Figure 2.11 In the case of a Gaussian distribution, with θ
corresponding to the mean µ, the regression
function illustrated in Figure 2.10 takes the form
of a straight line, as shown in red.
In this
case, the random variable z corresponds to the
derivative of the log likelihood function and is
given by (x − µML)/σ2, and its expectation that
deﬁnes the regression function is a straight line
given by (µ − µML)/σ2. The root of the regres-
sion function corresponds to the maximum like-
lihood estimator µML.

σ2 (x − µML).

z = ∂

ln p(x|µML, σ2) =

(2.136)
Thus the distribution of z is Gaussian with mean µ − µML, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 2.11. Substituting (2.136) into (2.135), we obtain the univariate form of (2.126),
provided we choose the coefﬁcients aN to have the form aN = σ2/N. Note that
although we have focussed on the case of a single variable, the same technique,
together with the same restrictions (2.130)–(2.132) on the coefﬁcients aN , apply
equally to the multivariate case (Blum, 1965).

2.3.6 Bayesian inference for the Gaussian
The maximum likelihood framework gave point estimates for the parameters µ
and Σ. Now we develop a Bayesian treatment by introducing prior distributions
over these parameters. Let us begin with a simple example in which we consider a
single Gaussian random variable x. We shall suppose that the variance σ2 is known,
and we consider the task of inferring the mean µ given a set of N observations
X = {x1, . . . , xN}. The likelihood function, that is the probability of the observed
data given µ, viewed as a function of µ, is given by

1

p(X|µ) =

p(xn|µ) =

(2.137)
Again we emphasize that the likelihood function p(X|µ) is not a probability distri-
bution over µ and is not normalized.

We see that the likelihood function takes the form of the exponential of a quad-
ratic form in µ. Thus if we choose a prior p(µ) given by a Gaussian, it will be a

conjugate distribution for this likelihood function because the corresponding poste-
rior will be a product of two exponentials of quadratic functions of µ and hence will
also be Gaussian. We therefore take our prior distribution to be

p(µ) = N(cid:10)

(cid:11)

and the posterior distribution is given by

p(µ|X) ∝ p(X|µ)p(µ).

(2.143)

It is worth spending a moment studying the form of the posterior mean and
variance. First of all, we note that the mean of the posterior distribution given by
(2.141) is a compromise between the prior mean µ0 and the maximum likelihood
solution µML. If the number of observed data points N = 0, then (2.141) reduces
to the prior mean as expected. For N → ∞, the posterior mean is given by the
maximum likelihood solution. Similarly, consider the result (2.142) for the variance
of the posterior distribution. We see that this is most naturally expressed in terms
of the inverse variance, which is called the precision. Furthermore, the precisions
are additive, so that the precision of the posterior is given by the precision of the
prior plus one contribution of the data precision from each of the observed data
points. As we increase the number of observed data points, the precision steadily
increases, corresponding to a posterior distribution with steadily decreasing variance.
With no observed data points, we have the prior variance, whereas if the number of
data points N → ∞, the variance σ2
N goes to zero and the posterior distribution
becomes inﬁnitely peaked around the maximum likelihood solution. We therefore
see that the maximum likelihood result of a point estimate for µ given by (2.143) is
recovered precisely from the Bayesian formalism in the limit of an inﬁnite number
0 → ∞ in which the

Section 2.3.5

We illustrate our analysis of Bayesian inference for the mean of a Gaussian
distribution in Figure 2.12. The generalization of this result to the case of a D-
dimensional Gaussian random variable x with known covariance and unknown mean
is straightforward.

We have already seen how the maximum likelihood expression for the mean of
a Gaussian can be re-cast as a sequential update formula in which the mean after
observing N data points was expressed in terms of the mean after observing N − 1
data points together with the contribution from data point xN . In fact, the Bayesian
paradigm leads very naturally to a sequential view of the inference problem. To see
this in the context of the inference of the mean of a Gaussian, we write the posterior
distribution with the contribution from the ﬁnal data point xN separated out so that

N−1(cid:14)

 

p(µ|D) ∝

p(µ)

p(xn|µ)

p(xN|µ).

(2.144)

n=1

The term in square brackets is (up to a normalization coefﬁcient) just the posterior
distribution after observing N − 1 data points. We see that this can be viewed as
a prior distribution, which is combined using Bayes’ theorem with the likelihood
function associated with data point xN to arrive at the posterior distribution after
observing N data points. This sequential view of Bayesian inference is very general
and applies to any problem in which the observed data are assumed to be independent
and identically distributed.

So far, we have assumed that the variance of the Gaussian distribution over the
data is known and our goal is to infer the mean. Now let us suppose that the mean
is known and we wish to infer the variance. Again, our calculations will be greatly
simpliﬁed if we choose a conjugate form for the prior distribution. It turns out to be
most convenient to work with the precision λ ≡ 1/σ2. The likelihood function for λ

2.3. The Gaussian Distribution

From (2.150), we see that the effect of observing N data points is to increase
the value of the coefﬁcient a by N/2. Thus we can interpret the parameter a0 in
the prior in terms of 2a0 ‘effective’ prior observations. Similarly, from (2.151) we
see that the N data points contribute N σ2
ML is
the variance, and so we can interpret the parameter b0 in the prior as arising from
the 2a0 ‘effective’ prior observations having variance 2b0/(2a0) = b0/a0. Recall
that we made an analogous interpretation for the Dirichlet prior. These distributions
are examples of the exponential family, and we shall see that the interpretation of
a conjugate prior in terms of effective ﬁctitious data points is a general one for the
exponential family of distributions.

Instead of working with the precision, we can consider the variance itself. The
conjugate prior in this case is called the inverse gamma distribution, although we

of an independent Gaussian prior over µ and a gamma prior over λ, because the
precision of µ is a linear function of λ. Even if we chose a prior in which µ and λ
were independent, the posterior distribution would exhibit a coupling between the
precision of µ and the value of λ.

Again, it is also possible to deﬁne a conjugate prior over the covariance matrix itself,
rather than over the precision matrix, which leads to the inverse Wishart distribu-
tion, although we shall not discuss this further. If both the mean and the precision
are unknown, then, following a similar line of reasoning to the univariate case, the
conjugate prior is given by

p(µ, Λ|µ0, β, W, ν) = N (µ|µ0, (βΛ)−1)W(Λ|W, ν)

(2.157)

which is known as the normal-Wishart or Gaussian-Wishart distribution.

2.3.7 Student’s t-distribution
We have seen that the conjugate prior for the precision of a Gaussian is given
by a gamma distribution. If we have a univariate Gaussian N (x|µ, τ
−1) together
with a Gamma prior Gam(τ|a, b) and we integrate out the precision, we obtain the
marginal distribution of x in the form

which is known as Student’s t-distribution. The parameter λ is sometimes called the
precision of the t-distribution, even though it is not in general equal to the inverse
of the variance. The parameter ν is called the degrees of freedom, and its effect is
illustrated in Figure 2.15. For the particular case of ν = 1, the t-distribution reduces
to the Cauchy distribution, while in the limit ν → ∞ the t-distribution St(x|µ, λ, ν)
becomes a Gaussian N (x|µ, λ

−1) with mean µ and precision λ.

From (2.158), we see that Student’s t-distribution is obtained by adding up an
inﬁnite number of Gaussian distributions having the same mean but different preci-
sions. This can be interpreted as an inﬁnite mixture of Gaussians (Gaussian mixtures
will be discussed in detail in Section 2.3.9. The result is a distribution that in gen-
eral has longer ‘tails’ than a Gaussian, as was seen in Figure 2.15. This gives the t-
distribution an important property called robustness, which means that it is much less
sensitive than the Gaussian to the presence of a few data points which are outliers.
The robustness of the t-distribution is illustrated in Figure 2.16, which compares the
maximum likelihood solutions for a Gaussian and a t-distribution. Note that the max-
imum likelihood solution for the t-distribution can be found using the expectation-
maximization (EM) algorithm. Here we see that the effect of a small number of

the t-distribution contains the Gaussian as a special case it gives almost the same solution as the Gaussian.
(b) The same data set but with three additional outlying data points showing how the Gaussian (green curve) is

outliers is much less signiﬁcant for the t-distribution than for the Gaussian. Outliers
can arise in practical applications either because the process that generates the data
corresponds to a distribution having a heavy tail or simply through mislabelled data.
Robustness is also an important property for regression problems. Unsurprisingly,
the least squares approach to regression does not exhibit robustness, because it cor-
responds to maximum likelihood under a (conditional) Gaussian distribution. By
basing a regression model on a heavy-tailed distribution such as a t-distribution, we
obtain a more robust model.

If we go back to (2.158) and substitute the alternative parameters ν = 2a, λ =

a/b, and η = τ b/a, we see that the t-distribution can be written in the form

St(x|µ, λ, ν) =

x|µ, (ηλ)−1

Gam(η|ν/2, ν/2) dη.

(2.160)
We can then generalize this to a multivariate Gaussian N (x|µ, Λ) to obtain the cor-
responding multivariate Student’s t-distribution in the form

St(x|µ, Λ, ν) =

N (x|µ, (ηΛ)−1)Gam(η|ν/2, ν/2) dη.

2.3.8 Periodic variables
Although Gaussian distributions are of great practical signiﬁcance, both in their
own right and as building blocks for more complex probabilistic models, there are
situations in which they are inappropriate as density models for continuous vari-
ables. One important case, which arises in practical applications, is that of periodic
variables.

An example of a periodic variable would be the wind direction at a particular
geographical location. We might, for instance, measure values of wind direction on a
number of days and wish to summarize this using a parametric distribution. Another
example is calendar time, where we may be interested in modelling quantities that
are believed to be periodic over 24 hours or over an annual cycle. Such quantities
can conveniently be represented using an angular (polar) coordinate 0 (cid:1) θ < 2π.

and θ2 = 359◦

We might be tempted to treat periodic variables by choosing some direction
as the origin and then applying a conventional distribution such as the Gaussian.
Such an approach, however, would give results that were strongly dependent on the
arbitrary choice of origin. Suppose, for instance, that we have two observations at
θ1 = 1◦
, and we model them using a standard univariate Gaussian
distribution. If we choose the origin at 0◦
, then the sample mean of this data set
will be 180◦
with standard deviation 179◦
, whereas if we choose the origin at 180◦
,
then the mean will be 0◦
. We clearly need to
develop a special approach for the treatment of periodic variables.
Let us consider the problem of evaluating the mean of a set of observations
D = {θ1, . . . , θN} of a periodic variable. From now on, we shall assume that θ is
measured in radians. We have already seen that the simple average (θ1+···+θN )/N
will be strongly coordinate dependent. To ﬁnd an invariant measure of the mean, we
note that the observations can be viewed as points on the unit circle and can therefore
be described instead by two-dimensional unit vectors x1, . . . , xN where (cid:5)xn(cid:5) = 1
for n = 1, . . . , N, as illustrated in Figure 2.17. We can average the vectors {xn}

and the standard deviation will be 1◦

and then ﬁnd the corresponding angle θ of this average. Clearly, this deﬁnition will
ensure that the location of the mean is independent of the origin of the angular coor-
dinate. Note that x will typically lie inside the unit circle. The Cartesian coordinates
of the observations are given by xn = (cos θn, sin θn), and we can write the Carte-
sian coordinates of the sample mean in the form x = (r cos θ, r sin θ). Substituting
into (2.167) and equating the x1 and x2 components then gives

Shortly, we shall see how this result arises naturally as the maximum likelihood
estimator for an appropriately deﬁned distribution over a periodic variable.

We now consider a periodic generalization of the Gaussian called the von Mises
distribution. Here we shall limit our attention to univariate distributions, although
periodic distributions can also be found over hyperspheres of arbitrary dimension.
For an extensive discussion of periodic distributions, see Mardia and Jupp (2000).

By convention, we will consider distributions p(θ) that have period 2π. Any
probability density p(θ) deﬁned over θ must not only be nonnegative and integrate

2.3. The Gaussian Distribution

a two-dimensional Gaussian of the form (2.173), whose
density contours are shown in blue and conditioning on

to one, but it must also be periodic. Thus p(θ) must satisfy the three conditions

(2.170)

(2.171)

(2.172)

p(θ) dθ = 1

0

p(θ + 2π) = p(θ).

From (2.172), it follows that p(θ + M2π) = p(θ) for any integer M.

We can easily obtain a Gaussian-like distribution that satisﬁes these three prop-
erties as follows. Consider a Gaussian distribution over two variables x = (x1, x2)
having mean µ = (µ1, µ2) and a covariance matrix Σ = σ2I where I is the 2 × 2
identity matrix, so that

p(x1, x2) =

1
2πσ2 exp

−(x1 − µ1)2 + (x2 − µ2)2

2σ2

.

(2.173)

(cid:12)

(cid:13)

The contours of constant p(x) are circles, as illustrated in Figure 2.18. Now suppose
we consider the value of this distribution along a circle of ﬁxed radius. Then by con-
struction this distribution will be periodic, although it will not be normalized. We can
determine the form of this distribution by transforming from Cartesian coordinates
(x1, x2) to polar coordinates (r, θ) so that

x2 = r sin θ.
We also map the mean µ into polar coordinates by writing

x1 = r cos θ,

µ1 = r0 cos θ0,

µ2 = r0 sin θ0.

(2.174)

(2.175)

Next we substitute these transformations into the two-dimensional Gaussian distribu-
tion (2.173), and then condition on the unit circle r = 1, noting that we are interested
only in the dependence on θ. Focussing on the exponent in the Gaussian distribution
we have

which is called the von Mises distribution, or the circular normal. Here the param-
eter θ0 corresponds to the mean of the distribution, while m, which is known as
the concentration parameter, is analogous to the inverse variance (precision) for the
Gaussian. The normalization coefﬁcient in (2.179) is expressed in terms of I0(m),
which is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind (Abramowitz and Stegun,
1965) and is deﬁned by

tribution is plotted in Figure 2.19, and the function I0(m) is plotted in Figure 2.20.

Now consider the maximum likelihood estimators for the parameters θ0 and m

for the von Mises distribution. The log likelihood function is given by
cos(θn − θ0).

The right-hand side of (2.187) is easily evaluated, and the function A(m) can be
inverted numerically.

For completeness, we mention brieﬂy some alternative techniques for the con-
struction of periodic distributions. The simplest approach is to use a histogram of
observations in which the angular coordinate is divided into ﬁxed bins. This has the
virtue of simplicity and ﬂexibility but also suffers from signiﬁcant limitations, as we
shall see when we discuss histogram methods in more detail in Section 2.5. Another
approach starts, like the von Mises distribution, from a Gaussian distribution over a
Euclidean space but now marginalizes onto the unit circle rather than conditioning
(Mardia and Jupp, 2000). However, this leads to more complex forms of distribution
and will not be discussed further. Finally, any valid distribution over the real axis
(such as a Gaussian) can be turned into a periodic distribution by mapping succes-
sive intervals of width 2π onto the periodic variable (0, 2π), which corresponds to
‘wrapping’ the real axis around unit circle. Again, the resulting distribution is more
complex to handle than the von Mises distribution.

One limitation of the von Mises distribution is that it is unimodal. By forming
mixtures of von Mises distributions, we obtain a ﬂexible framework for modelling
periodic variables that can handle multimodality. For an example of a machine learn-
ing application that makes use of von Mises distributions, see Lawrence et al. (2002),
and for extensions to modelling conditional densities for regression problems, see
Bishop and Nabney (1996).

2.3.9 Mixtures of Gaussians
While the Gaussian distribution has some important analytical properties, it suf-
fers from signiﬁcant limitations when it comes to modelling real data sets. Consider
the example shown in Figure 2.21. This is known as the ‘Old Faithful’ data set,
and comprises 272 measurements of the eruption of the Old Faithful geyser at Yel-
lowstone National Park in the USA. Each measurement comprises the duration of

p(x)

the eruption in minutes (horizontal axis) and the time in minutes to the next erup-
tion (vertical axis). We see that the data set forms two dominant clumps, and that
a simple Gaussian distribution is unable to capture this structure, whereas a linear
superposition of two Gaussians gives a better characterization of the data set.

x

Such superpositions, formed by taking linear combinations of more basic dis-
tributions such as Gaussians, can be formulated as probabilistic models known as
mixture distributions (McLachlan and Basford, 1988; McLachlan and Peel, 2000).
In Figure 2.22 we see that a linear combination of Gaussians can give rise to very
complex densities. By using a sufﬁcient number of Gaussians, and by adjusting their
means and covariances as well as the coefﬁcients in the linear combination, almost
any continuous density can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy.

We therefore consider a superposition of K Gaussian densities of the form

p(x) =

πkN (x|µk, Σk)

(2.188)

k=1

which is called a mixture of Gaussians. Each Gaussian density N (x|µk, Σk) is
called a component of the mixture and has its own mean µk and covariance Σk.
Contour and surface plots for a Gaussian mixture having 3 components are shown in
Figure 2.23.

In this section we shall consider Gaussian components to illustrate the frame-
work of mixture models. More generally, mixture models can comprise linear com-
binations of other distributions. For instance, in Section 9.3.3 we shall consider
mixtures of Bernoulli distributions as an example of a mixture model for discrete
variables.

Section 9.3.3

The parameters πk in (2.188) are called mixing coefﬁcients. If we integrate both
sides of (2.188) with respect to x, and note that both p(x) and the individual Gaussian
components are normalized, we obtain

K(cid:2)

K(cid:2)

πk = 1.

(2.189)

Also, the requirement that p(x) (cid:2) 0, together with N (x|µk, Σk) (cid:2) 0, implies
πk (cid:2) 0 for all k. Combining this with the condition (2.189) we obtain

k=1

0 (cid:1) πk (cid:1) 1.

We therefore see that the mixing coefﬁcients satisfy the requirements to be probabil-

From the sum and product rules, the marginal density is given by

p(x) =

(2.191)

K(cid:2)

which is equivalent to (2.188) in which we can view πk = p(k) as the prior prob-
ability of picking the kth component, and the density N (x|µk, Σk) = p(x|k) as
the probability of x conditioned on k. As we shall see in later chapters, an impor-
tant role is played by the posterior probabilities p(k|x), which are also known as
responsibilities. From Bayes’ theorem these are given by

γk(x) ≡ p(k|x)

(cid:5)

(cid:5)

We shall discuss the probabilistic interpretation of the mixture distribution in greater
detail in Chapter 9.
The form of the Gaussian mixture distribution is governed by the parameters π,
µ and Σ, where we have used the notation π ≡ {π1, . . . , πK}, µ ≡ {µ1, . . . , µK}
and Σ ≡ {Σ1, . . . ΣK}. One way to set the values of these parameters is to use
maximum likelihood. From (2.188) the log of the likelihood function is given by

where X = {x1, . . . , xN}. We immediately see that the situation is now much
more complex than with a single Gaussian, due to the presence of the summation
over k inside the logarithm. As a result, the maximum likelihood solution for the
parameters no longer has a closed-form analytical solution. One approach to maxi-
mizing the likelihood function is to use iterative numerical optimization techniques
(Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Alterna-
tively we can employ a powerful framework called expectation maximization, which
will be discussed at length in Chapter 9.

2.4. The Exponential Family

The probability distributions that we have studied so far in this chapter (with the
exception of the Gaussian mixture) are speciﬁc examples of a broad class of distri-
butions called the exponential family (Duda and Hart, 1973; Bernardo and Smith,
1994). Members of the exponential family have many important properties in com-
mon, and it is illuminating to discuss these properties in some generality.

The exponential family of distributions over x, given parameters η, is deﬁned to

be the set of distributions of the form

p(x|η) = h(x)g(η) exp

ηTu(x)

(2.194)

where x may be scalar or vector, and may be discrete or continuous. Here η are
called the natural parameters of the distribution, and u(x) is some function of x.
The function g(η) can be interpreted as the coefﬁcient that ensures that the distribu-
tion is normalized and therefore satisﬁes

We begin by taking some examples of the distributions introduced earlier in
the chapter and showing that they are indeed members of the exponential family.
Consider ﬁrst the Bernoulli distribution

p(x|µ) = Bern(x|µ) = µx(1 − µ)1−x.

(2.196)

Expressing the right-hand side as the exponential of the logarithm, we have

which we can solve for µ to give µ = σ(η), where

σ(η) =

1 + exp(−η)

(2.199)

is called the logistic sigmoid function. Thus we can write the Bernoulli distribution
using the standard representation (2.194) in the form
p(x|η) = σ(−η) exp(ηx)

(2.200)
where we have used 1 − σ(η) = σ(−η), which is easily proved from (2.199). Com-
parison with (2.194) shows that

Next consider the multinomial distribution that, for a single observation x, takes

the form

p(x|µ) =

h(x) = 1
g(η) = σ(−η).

h(x) = 1
g(η) = 1.

Note that the parameters ηk are not independent because the parameters µk are sub-

(2.209)
so that, given any M − 1 of the parameters µk, the value of the remaining parameter
is ﬁxed. In some circumstances, it will be convenient to remove this constraint by
expressing the distribution in terms of only M − 1 parameters. This can be achieved
by using the relationship (2.209) to eliminate µM by expressing it in terms of the
remaining {µk} where k = 1, . . . , M − 1, thereby leaving M − 1 parameters. Note
that these remaining parameters are still subject to the constraints

Making use of the constraint (2.209), the multinomial distribution in this representa-

2.4.1 Maximum likelihood and sufﬁcient statistics
Let us now consider the problem of estimating the parameter vector η in the gen-
eral exponential family distribution (2.194) using the technique of maximum likeli-
hood. Taking the gradient of both sides of (2.195) with respect to η, we have

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

∇g(η)

h(x) exp

+ g(η)

h(x) exp

u(x) dx = 0.

Rearranging, and making use again of (2.195) then gives

g(η)

∇g(η) = g(η)

h(x) exp

ηTu(x)

u(x) dx = E[u(x)]

where we have used (2.194). We therefore obtain the result

−∇ ln g(η) = E[u(x)].

(2.225)

(2.226)

Note that the covariance of u(x) can be expressed in terms of the second derivatives
of g(η), and similarly for higher order moments. Thus, provided we can normalize a
distribution from the exponential family, we can always ﬁnd its moments by simple
differentiation.
N(cid:2)

Setting the gradient of ln p(X|η) with respect to η to zero, we get the following
condition to be satisﬁed by the maximum likelihood estimator ηML

−∇ ln g(ηML) =

1

u(xn)

(2.228)

N(cid:2)

n=1

which can in principle be solved to obtain ηML. We see that the solution for the
n u(xn), which
maximum likelihood estimator depends on the data only through
is therefore called the sufﬁcient statistic of the distribution (2.194). We do not need
to store the entire data set itself but only the value of the sufﬁcient statistic. For
the Bernoulli distribution, for example, the function u(x) is given just by x and
so we need only keep the sum of the data points {xn}, whereas for the Gaussian
u(x) = (x, x2)T, and so we should keep both the sum of {xn} and the sum of {x2
n}.
If we consider the limit N → ∞, then the right-hand side of (2.228) becomes
E[u(x)], and so by comparing with (2.226) we see that in this limit ηML will equal
the true value η.

In fact, this sufﬁciency property holds also for Bayesian inference, although
we shall defer discussion of this until Chapter 8 when we have equipped ourselves
with the tools of graphical models and can thereby gain a deeper insight into these
important concepts.

2.4.2 Conjugate priors
We have already encountered the concept of a conjugate prior several times, for
example in the context of the Bernoulli distribution (for which the conjugate prior
is the beta distribution) or the Gaussian (where the conjugate prior for the mean is
a Gaussian, and the conjugate prior for the precision is the Wishart distribution). In
general, for a given probability distribution p(x|η), we can seek a prior p(η) that is
conjugate to the likelihood function, so that the posterior distribution has the same
functional form as the prior. For any member of the exponential family (2.194), there
exists a conjugate prior that can be written in the form
p(η|χ, ν) = f(χ, ν)g(η)ν exp

νηTχ

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

(2.229)

where f(χ, ν) is a normalization coefﬁcient, and g(η) is the same function as ap-
pears in (2.194). To see that this is indeed conjugate, let us multiply the prior (2.229)
by the likelihood function (2.227) to obtain the posterior distribution, up to a nor-
malization coefﬁcient, in the form

(cid:24)

(cid:22)

(cid:5)

p(η|X, χ, ν) ∝ g(η)ν+N exp

ηT

u(xn) + νχ

.

(2.230)

n=1

This again takes the same functional form as the prior (2.229), conﬁrming conjugacy.
Furthermore, we see that the parameter ν can be interpreted as a effective number of
pseudo-observations in the prior, each of which has a value for the sufﬁcient statistic
u(x) given by χ.

2.4.3 Noninformative priors
In some applications of probabilistic inference, we may have prior knowledge
that can be conveniently expressed through the prior distribution. For example, if
the prior assigns zero probability to some value of variable, then the posterior dis-
tribution will necessarily also assign zero probability to that value, irrespective of

118

2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

any subsequent observations of data. In many cases, however, we may have little
idea of what form the distribution should take. We may then seek a form of prior
distribution, called a noninformative prior, which is intended to have as little inﬂu-
ence on the posterior distribution as possible (Jeffries, 1946; Box and Tao, 1973;
Bernardo and Smith, 1994). This is sometimes referred to as ‘letting the data speak
for themselves’.
If we have a distribution p(x|λ) governed by a parameter λ, we might be tempted
to propose a prior distribution p(λ) = const as a suitable prior. If λ is a discrete
variable with K states, this simply amounts to setting the prior probability of each
state to 1/K. In the case of continuous parameters, however, there are two potential
difﬁculties with this approach. The ﬁrst is that, if the domain of λ is unbounded,
this prior distribution cannot be correctly normalized because the integral over λ
diverges. Such priors are called improper. In practice, improper priors can often
be used provided the corresponding posterior distribution is proper, i.e., that it can
be correctly normalized. For instance, if we put a uniform prior distribution over
the mean of a Gaussian, then the posterior distribution for the mean, once we have
observed at least one data point, will be proper.

A second difﬁculty arises from the transformation behaviour of a probability
density under a nonlinear change of variables, given by (1.27). If a function h(λ)

is constant, and we change variables to λ = η2, then(cid:1)h(η) = h(η2) will also be

constant. However, if we choose the density pλ(λ) to be constant, then the density
of η will be given, from (1.27), by

(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7) dλ

dη

(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7) = pλ(η2)2η ∝ η

pη(η) = pλ(λ)

(2.231)

and so the density over η will not be constant. This issue does not arise when we use
maximum likelihood, because the likelihood function p(x|λ) is a simple function of
λ and so we are free to use any convenient parameterization. If, however, we are to
choose a prior distribution that is constant, we must take care to use an appropriate
representation for the parameters.

Here we consider two simple examples of noninformative priors (Berger, 1985).

First of all, if a density takes the form

p(x|µ) = f(x − µ)

(2.232)

then the parameter µ is known as a location parameter. This family of densities

exhibits translation invariance because if we shift x by a constant to give(cid:1)x = x + c,
where we have deﬁned(cid:1)µ = µ + c. Thus the density takes the same form in the

p((cid:1)x|(cid:1)µ) = f((cid:1)x −(cid:1)µ)

(2.233)

then

new variable as in the original one, and so the density is independent of the choice
of origin. We would like to choose a prior distribution that reﬂects this translation
invariance property, and so we choose a prior that assigns equal probability mass to

2.4. The Exponential Family

119

an interval A (cid:1) µ (cid:1) B as to the shifted interval A − c (cid:1) µ (cid:1) B − c. This implies

(cid:6) B

(cid:6) B−c

(cid:6) B

p(µ) dµ =

A

A−c

p(µ) dµ =

A

p(µ − c) dµ

(2.234)

and because this must hold for all choices of A and B, we have

p(µ − c) = p(µ)

(2.235)

which implies that p(µ) is constant. An example of a location parameter would be
the mean µ of a Gaussian distribution. As we have seen, the conjugate prior distri-
bution for µ in this case is a Gaussian p(µ|µ0, σ2
0), and we obtain a
0 → ∞. Indeed, from (2.141) and (2.142)
noninformative prior by taking the limit σ2
we see that this gives a posterior distribution over µ in which the contributions from
(cid:17)
the prior vanish.

0) = N (µ|µ0, σ2
(cid:18)

As a second example, consider a density of the form

p(x|σ) =

1
σ

f

x
σ

(2.236)

Exercise 2.59

where σ > 0. Note that this will be a normalized density provided f(x) is correctly
normalized. The parameter σ is known as a scale parameter, and the density exhibits

scale invariance because if we scale x by a constant to give(cid:1)x = cx, then
where we have deﬁned(cid:1)σ = cσ. This transformation corresponds to a change of

p((cid:1)x|(cid:1)σ) =

(cid:15)(cid:1)x(cid:1)σ

(2.237)

(cid:16)

1(cid:1)σ

f

scale, for example from meters to kilometers if x is a length, and we would like
to choose a prior distribution that reﬂects this scale invariance. If we consider an
interval A (cid:1) σ (cid:1) B, and a scaled interval A/c (cid:1) σ (cid:1) B/c, then the prior should
assign equal probability mass to these two intervals. Thus we have

(cid:6) B

(cid:6) B/c

p(σ) dσ =

(cid:15)

(cid:16)

p(σ) = p

σ

(2.239)
and hence p(σ) ∝ 1/σ. Note that again this is an improper prior because the integral
of the distribution over 0 (cid:1) σ (cid:1) ∞ is divergent. It is sometimes also convenient
to think of the prior distribution for a scale parameter in terms of the density of the
log of the parameter. Using the transformation rule (1.27) for densities we see that
p(ln σ) = const. Thus, for this prior there is the same probability mass in the range
1 (cid:1) σ (cid:1) 10 as in the range 10 (cid:1) σ (cid:1) 100 and in 100 (cid:1) σ (cid:1) 1000.

2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

(cid:26)−((cid:4)x/σ)2

(cid:27)

An example of a scale parameter would be the standard deviation σ of a Gaussian

distribution, after we have taken account of the location parameter µ, because

where(cid:4)x = x − µ. As discussed earlier, it is often more convenient to work in terms

N (x|µ, σ2) ∝ σ

−1 exp

of the precision λ = 1/σ2 rather than σ itself. Using the transformation rule for
densities, we see that a distribution p(σ) ∝ 1/σ corresponds to a distribution over λ
of the form p(λ) ∝ 1/λ. We have seen that the conjugate prior for λ was the gamma
distribution Gam(λ|a0, b0) given by (2.146). The noninformative prior is obtained
as the special case a0 = b0 = 0. Again, if we examine the results (2.150) and (2.151)
for the posterior distribution of λ, we see that for a0 = b0 = 0, the posterior depends
only on terms arising from the data and not from the prior.

(2.240)

Section 2.3

2.5. Nonparametric Methods

Throughout this chapter, we have focussed on the use of probability distributions
having speciﬁc functional forms governed by a small number of parameters whose
values are to be determined from a data set. This is called the parametric approach
to density modelling. An important limitation of this approach is that the chosen
density might be a poor model of the distribution that generates the data, which can
result in poor predictive performance. For instance, if the process that generates the
data is multimodal, then this aspect of the distribution can never be captured by a
Gaussian, which is necessarily unimodal.

In this ﬁnal section, we consider some nonparametric approaches to density es-
timation that make few assumptions about the form of the distribution. Here we shall
focus mainly on simple frequentist methods. The reader should be aware, however,
that nonparametric Bayesian methods are attracting increasing interest (Walker et al.,
1999; Neal, 2000; M¨uller and Quintana, 2004; Teh et al., 2006).

Let us start with a discussion of histogram methods for density estimation, which
we have already encountered in the context of marginal and conditional distributions
in Figure 1.11 and in the context of the central limit theorem in Figure 2.6. Here we
explore the properties of histogram density models in more detail, focussing on the
case of a single continuous variable x. Standard histograms simply partition x into
distinct bins of width ∆i and then count the number ni of observations of x falling
in bin i. In order to turn this count into a normalized probability density, we simply
divide by the total number N of observations and by the width ∆i of the bins to
obtain probability values for each bin given by
pi = ni
N∆i

(2.241)

p(x) dx = 1. This gives a model for the density
for which it is easily seen that
p(x) that is constant over the width of each bin, and often the bins are chosen to have
the same width ∆i = ∆.

(cid:28)

to density estimation, in which a data set
of 50 data points is generated from the
distribution shown by the green curve.

In Figure 2.24, we show an example of histogram density estimation. Here
the data is drawn from the distribution, corresponding to the green curve, which is
formed from a mixture of two Gaussians. Also shown are three examples of his-
togram density estimates corresponding to three different choices for the bin width
∆. We see that when ∆ is very small (top ﬁgure), the resulting density model is very
spiky, with a lot of structure that is not present in the underlying distribution that
generated the data set. Conversely, if ∆ is too large (bottom ﬁgure) then the result is
a model that is too smooth and that consequently fails to capture the bimodal prop-
erty of the green curve. The best results are obtained for some intermediate value
of ∆ (middle ﬁgure). In principle, a histogram density model is also dependent on
the choice of edge location for the bins, though this is typically much less signiﬁcant
than the value of ∆.

Note that the histogram method has the property (unlike the methods to be dis-
cussed shortly) that, once the histogram has been computed, the data set itself can
be discarded, which can be advantageous if the data set is large. Also, the histogram
approach is easily applied if the data points are arriving sequentially.

In practice, the histogram technique can be useful for obtaining a quick visual-
ization of data in one or two dimensions but is unsuited to most density estimation
applications. One obvious problem is that the estimated density has discontinuities
that are due to the bin edges rather than any property of the underlying distribution
that generated the data. Another major limitation of the histogram approach is its
scaling with dimensionality. If we divide each variable in a D-dimensional space
into M bins, then the total number of bins will be M D. This exponential scaling
with D is an example of the curse of dimensionality. In a space of high dimensional-
ity, the quantity of data needed to provide meaningful estimates of local probability
density would be prohibitive.

The histogram approach to density estimation does, however, teach us two im-
portant lessons. First, to estimate the probability density at a particular location,
we should consider the data points that lie within some local neighbourhood of that
point. Note that the concept of locality requires that we assume some form of dis-
tance measure, and here we have been assuming Euclidean distance. For histograms,

Section 1.4

122

2. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

this neighbourhood property was deﬁned by the bins, and there is a natural ‘smooth-
ing’ parameter describing the spatial extent of the local region, in this case the bin
width. Second, the value of the smoothing parameter should be neither too large nor
too small in order to obtain good results. This is reminiscent of the choice of model
complexity in polynomial curve ﬁtting discussed in Chapter 1 where the degree M
of the polynomial, or alternatively the value α of the regularization parameter, was
optimal for some intermediate value, neither too large nor too small. Armed with
these insights, we turn now to a discussion of two widely used nonparametric tech-
niques for density estimation, kernel estimators and nearest neighbours, which have
better scaling with dimensionality than the simple histogram model.

2.5.1 Kernel density estimators
Let us suppose that observations are being drawn from some unknown probabil-
ity density p(x) in some D-dimensional space, which we shall take to be Euclidean,
and we wish to estimate the value of p(x). From our earlier discussion of locality,
let us consider some small region R containing x. The probability mass associated
with this region is given by

(cid:6)

P =

R

p(x) dx.

(2.242)

Section 2.1

Now suppose that we have collected a data set comprising N observations drawn
from p(x). Because each data point has a probability P of falling within R, the total
number K of points that lie inside R will be distributed according to the binomial
distribution

Bin(K|N, P ) =

N!

K!(N − K)! P K(1 − P )1−K.

(2.243)

Using (2.11), we see that the mean fraction of points falling inside the region is
E[K/N] = P , and similarly using (2.12) we see that the variance around this mean
is var[K/N] = P (1 − P )/N. For large N, this distribution will be sharply peaked
around the mean and so
(2.244)
If, however, we also assume that the region R is sufﬁciently small that the probability
density p(x) is roughly constant over the region, then we have

K (cid:7) N P.

(2.245)
where V is the volume of R. Combining (2.244) and (2.245), we obtain our density
estimate in the form

.

(2.246)

P (cid:7) p(x)V

p(x) = K
N V

Note that the validity of (2.246) depends on two contradictory assumptions, namely
that the region R be sufﬁciently small that the density is approximately constant over
the region and yet sufﬁciently large (in relation to the value of that density) that the
number K of points falling inside the region is sufﬁcient for the binomial distribution
to be sharply peaked.

2.5. Nonparametric Methods

123

We can exploit the result (2.246) in two different ways. Either we can ﬁx K and
determine the value of V from the data, which gives rise to the K-nearest-neighbour
technique discussed shortly, or we can ﬁx V and determine K from the data, giv-
ing rise to the kernel approach. It can be shown that both the K-nearest-neighbour
density estimator and the kernel density estimator converge to the true probability
density in the limit N → ∞ provided V shrinks suitably with N, and K grows with
N (Duda and Hart, 1973).
We begin by discussing the kernel method in detail, and to start with we take
the region R to be a small hypercube centred on the point x at which we wish to
determine the probability density. In order to count the number K of points falling
within this region, it is convenient to deﬁne the following function

k(u) =

|ui| (cid:1) 1/2,
1,
0, otherwise

i = 1, . . . , D,

(2.247)

(cid:12)

which represents a unit cube centred on the origin. The function k(u) is an example
of a kernel function, and in this context is also called a Parzen window. From (2.247),
the quantity k((x− xn)/h) will be one if the data point xn lies inside a cube of side
h centred on x, and zero otherwise. The total number of data points lying inside this
cube will therefore be

(cid:17)

where we have used V = hD for the volume of a hypercube of side h in D di-
mensions. Using the symmetry of the function k(u), we can now re-interpret this
equation, not as a single cube centred on x but as the sum over N cubes centred on
the N data points xn.

As it stands, the kernel density estimator (2.249) will suffer from one of the same
problems that the histogram method suffered from, namely the presence of artiﬁcial
discontinuities, in this case at the boundaries of the cubes. We can obtain a smoother
density model if we choose a smoother kernel function, and a common choice is the
Gaussian, which gives rise to the following kernel density model

where h represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian components. Thus our
density model is obtained by placing a Gaussian over each data point and then adding
up the contributions over the whole data set, and then dividing by N so that the den-
sity is correctly normalized. In Figure 2.25, we apply the model (2.250) to the data

smoothing parameter and that if it is set
too small (top panel), the result is a very
noisy density model, whereas if it is set
too large (bottom panel), then the bimodal
nature of the underlying distribution from
which the data is generated (shown by the

sity model is obtained for some intermedi-
ate value of h (middle panel).

set used earlier to demonstrate the histogram technique. We see that, as expected,
the parameter h plays the role of a smoothing parameter, and there is a trade-off
between sensitivity to noise at small h and over-smoothing at large h. Again, the
optimization of h is a problem in model complexity, analogous to the choice of bin
width in histogram density estimation, or the degree of the polynomial used in curve
ﬁtting.

We can choose any other kernel function k(u) in (2.249) subject to the condi-

tions

which ensure that the resulting probability distribution is nonnegative everywhere
and integrates to one. The class of density model given by (2.249) is called a kernel
density estimator, or Parzen estimator. It has a great merit that there is no compu-
tation involved in the ‘training’ phase because this simply requires storage of the
training set. However, this is also one of its great weaknesses because the computa-
tional cost of evaluating the density grows linearly with the size of the data set.

2.5.2 Nearest-neighbour methods
One of the difﬁculties with the kernel approach to density estimation is that the
parameter h governing the kernel width is ﬁxed for all kernels. In regions of high
data density, a large value of h may lead to over-smoothing and a washing out of
structure that might otherwise be extracted from the data. However, reducing h may
lead to noisy estimates elsewhere in data space where the density is smaller. Thus
the optimal choice for h may be dependent on location within the data space. This
issue is addressed by nearest-neighbour methods for density estimation.

We therefore return to our general result (2.246) for local density estimation,
and instead of ﬁxing V and determining the value of K from the data, we consider
a ﬁxed value of K and use the data to ﬁnd an appropriate value for V . To do this,
we consider a small sphere centred on the point x at which we wish to estimate the

sity estimation using the same data set
as in Figures 2.25 and 2.24. We see
that the parameter K governs the degree
of smoothing, so that a small value of
K leads to a very noisy density model
(top panel), whereas a large value (bot-
tom panel) smoothes out the bimodal na-
ture of the true distribution (shown by the
green curve) from which the data set was
generated.

density p(x), and we allow the radius of the sphere to grow until it contains precisely
K data points. The estimate of the density p(x) is then given by (2.246) with V set to
the volume of the resulting sphere. This technique is known as K nearest neighbours
and is illustrated in Figure 2.26, for various choices of the parameter K, using the
same data set as used in Figure 2.24 and Figure 2.25. We see that the value of K
now governs the degree of smoothing and that again there is an optimum choice for
K that is neither too large nor too small. Note that the model produced by K nearest
neighbours is not a true density model because the integral over all space diverges.
We close this chapter by showing how the K-nearest-neighbour technique for
density estimation can be extended to the problem of classiﬁcation. To do this, we
apply the K-nearest-neighbour density estimation technique to each class separately
and then make use of Bayes’ theorem. Let us suppose that we have a data set com-
prising Nk points in class Ck with N points in total, so that
k Nk = N. If we
wish to classify a new point x, we draw a sphere centred on x containing precisely
K points irrespective of their class. Suppose this sphere has volume V and contains
Kk points from class Ck. Then (2.246) provides an estimate of the density associated
with each class

(cid:5)

p(x|Ck) = Kk

Similarly, the unconditional density is given by
p(x) = K

while the class priors are given by

p(Ck) = Nk

the posterior probability of class membership

If we wish to minimize the probability of misclassiﬁcation, this is done by assigning
the test point x to the class having the largest posterior probability, corresponding to
the largest value of Kk/K. Thus to classify a new point, we identify the K nearest
points from the training data set and then assign the new point to the class having the
largest number of representatives amongst this set. Ties can be broken at random.
The particular case of K = 1 is called the nearest-neighbour rule, because a test
point is simply assigned to the same class as the nearest point from the training set.
These concepts are illustrated in Figure 2.27.

In Figure 2.28, we show the results of applying the K-nearest-neighbour algo-
rithm to the oil ﬂow data, introduced in Chapter 1, for various values of K. As
expected, we see that K controls the degree of smoothing, so that small K produces
many small regions of each class, whereas large K leads to fewer larger regions.

An interesting property of the nearest-neighbour (K = 1) classiﬁer is that, in the
limit N → ∞, the error rate is never more than twice the minimum achievable error
rate of an optimal classiﬁer, i.e., one that uses the true class distributions (Cover and
Hart, 1967) .

As discussed so far, both the K-nearest-neighbour method, and the kernel den-
sity estimator, require the entire training data set to be stored, leading to expensive
computation if the data set is large. This effect can be offset, at the expense of some
additional one-off computation, by constructing tree-based search structures to allow
(approximate) near neighbours to be found efﬁciently without doing an exhaustive
search of the data set. Nevertheless, these nonparametric methods are still severely
limited. On the other hand, we have seen that simple parametric models are very
restricted in terms of the forms of distribution that they can represent. We therefore
need to ﬁnd density models that are very ﬂexible and yet for which the complexity
of the models can be controlled independently of the size of the training set, and we
shall see in subsequent chapters how to achieve this.

Linear

Models for
Regression

The focus so far in this book has been on unsupervised learning, including topics
such as density estimation and data clustering. We turn now to a discussion of super-
vised learning, starting with regression. The goal of regression is to predict the value
of one or more continuous target variables t given the value of a D-dimensional vec-
tor x of input variables. We have already encountered an example of a regression
problem when we considered polynomial curve ﬁtting in Chapter 1. The polynomial
is a speciﬁc example of a broad class of functions called linear regression models,
which share the property of being linear functions of the adjustable parameters, and
which will form the focus of this chapter. The simplest form of linear regression
models are also linear functions of the input variables. However, we can obtain a
much more useful class of functions by taking linear combinations of a ﬁxed set of
nonlinear functions of the input variables, known as basis functions. Such models
are linear functions of the parameters, which gives them simple analytical properties,
and yet can be nonlinear with respect to the input variables.

137

138

3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION

Given a training data set comprising N observations {xn}, where n = 1, . . . , N,
together with corresponding target values {tn}, the goal is to predict the value of t
for a new value of x. In the simplest approach, this can be done by directly con-
structing an appropriate function y(x) whose values for new inputs x constitute the
predictions for the corresponding values of t. More generally, from a probabilistic
perspective, we aim to model the predictive distribution p(t|x) because this expresses
our uncertainty about the value of t for each value of x. From this conditional dis-
tribution we can make predictions of t, for any new value of x, in such a way as to
minimize the expected value of a suitably chosen loss function. As discussed in Sec-
tion 1.5.5, a common choice of loss function for real-valued variables is the squared
loss, for which the optimal solution is given by the conditional expectation of t.

Although linear models have signiﬁcant limitations as practical techniques for
pattern recognition, particularly for problems involving input spaces of high dimen-
sionality, they have nice analytical properties and form the foundation for more so-
phisticated models to be discussed in later chapters.

3.1. Linear Basis Function Models

The simplest linear model for regression is one that involves a linear combination of
the input variables

y(x, w) = w0 + w1x1 + . . . + wDxD

(3.1)

where x = (x1, . . . , xD)T. This is often simply known as linear regression. The key
property of this model is that it is a linear function of the parameters w0, . . . , wD. It is
also, however, a linear function of the input variables xi, and this imposes signiﬁcant
limitations on the model. We therefore extend the class of models by considering
linear combinations of ﬁxed nonlinear functions of the input variables, of the form

M−1(cid:2)

y(x, w) = w0 +

wjφj(x)

(3.2)

where φj(x) are known as basis functions. By denoting the maximum value of the
index j by M − 1, the total number of parameters in this model will be M.

j=1

The parameter w0 allows for any ﬁxed offset in the data and is sometimes called
a bias parameter (not to be confused with ‘bias’ in a statistical sense). It is often
convenient to deﬁne an additional dummy ‘basis function’ φ0(x) = 1 so that

M−1(cid:2)

y(x, w) =

wjφj(x) = wTφ(x)

(3.3)

j=0

where w = (w0, . . . , wM−1)T and φ = (φ0, . . . , φM−1)T. In many practical ap-
plications of pattern recognition, we will apply some form of ﬁxed pre-processing,

3.1. Linear Basis Function Models

139

or feature extraction, to the original data variables. If the original variables com-
prise the vector x, then the features can be expressed in terms of the basis functions
{φj(x)}.

By using nonlinear basis functions, we allow the function y(x, w) to be a non-
linear function of the input vector x. Functions of the form (3.2) are called linear
models, however, because this function is linear in w. It is this linearity in the pa-
rameters that will greatly simplify the analysis of this class of models. However, it
also leads to some signiﬁcant limitations, as we discuss in Section 3.6.

The example of polynomial regression considered in Chapter 1 is a particular
example of this model in which there is a single input variable x, and the basis func-
tions take the form of powers of x so that φj(x) = xj. One limitation of polynomial
basis functions is that they are global functions of the input variable, so that changes
in one region of input space affect all other regions. This can be resolved by dividing
the input space up into regions and ﬁt a different polynomial in each region, leading
to spline functions (Hastie et al., 2001).

There are many other possible choices for the basis functions, for example

(cid:12)
−(x − µj)2

(cid:13)

2s2

φj(x) = exp

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

where the µj govern the locations of the basis functions in input space, and the pa-
rameter s governs their spatial scale. These are usually referred to as ‘Gaussian’
basis functions, although it should be noted that they are not required to have a prob-
abilistic interpretation, and in particular the normalization coefﬁcient is unimportant
because these basis functions will be multiplied by adaptive parameters wj.

Another possibility is the sigmoidal basis function of the form

(cid:18)

(cid:17)

x − µj

s

φj(x) = σ

where σ(a) is the logistic sigmoid function deﬁned by

σ(a) =

1

1 + exp(−a) .

Equivalently, we can use the ‘tanh’ function because this is related to the logistic
sigmoid by tanh(a) = 2σ(a) − 1, and so a general linear combination of logistic
sigmoid functions is equivalent to a general linear combination of ‘tanh’ functions.
These various choices of basis function are illustrated in Figure 3.1.

Yet another possible choice of basis function is the Fourier basis, which leads to
an expansion in sinusoidal functions. Each basis function represents a speciﬁc fre-
quency and has inﬁnite spatial extent. By contrast, basis functions that are localized
to ﬁnite regions of input space necessarily comprise a spectrum of different spatial
frequencies. In many signal processing applications, it is of interest to consider ba-
sis functions that are localized in both space and frequency, leading to a class of
functions known as wavelets. These are also deﬁned to be mutually orthogonal, to
simplify their application. Wavelets are most applicable when the input values live

pixels in an image. Useful texts on wavelets include Ogden (1997), Mallat (1999),
and Vidakovic (1999).

Most of the discussion in this chapter, however, is independent of the particular
choice of basis function set, and so for most of our discussion we shall not specify
the particular form of the basis functions, except for the purposes of numerical il-
lustration. Indeed, much of our discussion will be equally applicable to the situation
in which the vector φ(x) of basis functions is simply the identity φ(x) = x. Fur-
thermore, in order to keep the notation simple, we shall focus on the case of a single
target variable t. However, in Section 3.1.5, we consider brieﬂy the modiﬁcations
needed to deal with multiple target variables.

3.1.1 Maximum likelihood and least squares
In Chapter 1, we ﬁtted polynomial functions to data sets by minimizing a sum-
of-squares error function. We also showed that this error function could be motivated
as the maximum likelihood solution under an assumed Gaussian noise model. Let
us return to this discussion and consider the least squares approach, and its relation
to maximum likelihood, in more detail.

As before, we assume that the target variable t is given by a deterministic func-

tion y(x, w) with additive Gaussian noise so that

t = y(x, w) + 

(3.7)

where  is a zero mean Gaussian random variable with precision (inverse variance)
β. Thus we can write

p(t|x, w, β) = N (t|y(x, w), β

−1).

(3.8)

Section 1.5.5

Recall that, if we assume a squared loss function, then the optimal prediction, for a
new value of x, will be given by the conditional mean of the target variable. In the
case of a Gaussian conditional distribution of the form (3.8), the conditional mean

will be simply

E[t|x] =

tp(t|x) dt = y(x, w).

Note that the Gaussian noise assumption implies that the conditional distribution of
t given x is unimodal, which may be inappropriate for some applications. An ex-
tension to mixtures of conditional Gaussian distributions, which permit multimodal
conditional distributions, will be discussed in Section 14.5.1.
Now consider a data set of inputs X = {x1, . . . , xN} with corresponding target
values t1, . . . , tN . We group the target variables {tn} into a column vector that we
denote by t where the typeface is chosen to distinguish it from a single observation
of a multivariate target, which would be denoted t. Making the assumption that
these data points are drawn independently from the distribution (3.8), we obtain the
following expression for the likelihood function, which is a function of the adjustable
parameters w and β, in the form

p(t|X, w, β) =

N (tn|wTφ(xn), β

−1)

(3.10)

where we have used (3.3). Note that in supervised learning problems such as regres-
sion (and classiﬁcation), we are not seeking to model the distribution of the input
variables. Thus x will always appear in the set of conditioning variables, and so
from now on we will drop the explicit x from expressions such as p(t|x, w, β) in or-
der to keep the notation uncluttered. Taking the logarithm of the likelihood function,
and making use of the standard form (1.46) for the univariate Gaussian, we have

ln p(t|w, β) =

lnN (tn|wTφ(xn), β

−1)

= N

ln β − N

ln(2π) − βED(w)

(3.11)

where the sum-of-squares error function is deﬁned by

ED(w) =

2

{tn − wTφ(xn)}2.

(3.12)

Having written down the likelihood function, we can use maximum likelihood to
determine w and β. Consider ﬁrst the maximization with respect to w. As observed
already in Section 1.2.5, we see that maximization of the likelihood function under a
conditional Gaussian noise distribution for a linear model is equivalent to minimizing
a sum-of-squares error function given by ED(w). The gradient of the log likelihood
function (3.11) takes the form

∇ ln p(t|w, β) =

tn − wTφ(xn)

is known as the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the matrix Φ (Rao and Mitra,

notion of matrix inverse to nonsquare matrices. Indeed, if Φ is square and invertible,
then using the property (AB)−1 = B−1A−1 we see that Φ

† ≡ Φ

−1.

At this point, we can gain some insight into the role of the bias parameter w0. If

we make the bias parameter explicit, then the error function (3.12) becomes

Thus the bias w0 compensates for the difference between the averages (over the

function values.

tor ϕj of length N with elements φj(xn).

and so we see that the inverse of the noise precision is given by the residual variance
of the target values around the regression function.

3.1.2 Geometry of least squares
At this point, it is instructive to consider the geometrical interpretation of the
least-squares solution. To do this we consider an N-dimensional space whose axes
are given by the tn, so that t = (t1, . . . , tN)T is a vector in this space. Each basis
function φj(xn), evaluated at the N data points, can also be represented as a vector in
the same space, denoted by ϕj, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. Note that ϕj corresponds
to the jth column of Φ, whereas φ(xn) corresponds to the nth row of Φ. If the
number M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of data points, then the
M vectors φj(xn) will span a linear subspace S of dimensionality M. We deﬁne
y to be an N-dimensional vector whose nth element is given by y(xn, w), where
n = 1, . . . , N. Because y is an arbitrary linear combination of the vectors ϕj, it can
live anywhere in the M-dimensional subspace. The sum-of-squares error (3.12) is
then equal (up to a factor of 1/2) to the squared Euclidean distance between y and
t. Thus the least-squares solution for w corresponds to that choice of y that lies in
subspace S and that is closest to t. Intuitively, from Figure 3.2, we anticipate that
this solution corresponds to the orthogonal projection of t onto the subspace S. This
is indeed the case, as can easily be veriﬁed by noting that the solution for y is given
by ΦwML, and then conﬁrming that this takes the form of an orthogonal projection.
In practice, a direct solution of the normal equations can lead to numerical difﬁ-
culties when ΦTΦ is close to singular. In particular, when two or more of the basis
vectors ϕj are co-linear, or nearly so, the resulting parameter values can have large
magnitudes. Such near degeneracies will not be uncommon when dealing with real
data sets. The resulting numerical difﬁculties can be addressed using the technique
of singular value decomposition, or SVD (Press et al., 1992; Bishop and Nabney,
2008). Note that the addition of a regularization term ensures that the matrix is non-
singular, even in the presence of degeneracies.

3.1.3 Sequential learning
Batch techniques, such as the maximum likelihood solution (3.15), which in-
volve processing the entire training set in one go, can be computationally costly for
large data sets. As we have discussed in Chapter 1, if the data set is sufﬁciently large,
it may be worthwhile to use sequential algorithms, also known as on-line algorithms,

Exercise 3.2

144

3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION

in which the data points are considered one at a time, and the model parameters up-
dated after each such presentation. Sequential learning is also appropriate for real-
time applications in which the data observations are arriving in a continuous stream,
and predictions must be made before all of the data points are seen.

We can obtain a sequential learning algorithm by applying the technique of
stochastic gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent, as follows. If
the error function comprises a sum over data points E =
n En, then after presen-
tation of pattern n, the stochastic gradient descent algorithm updates the parameter
vector w using

(cid:5)

(3.22)
where τ denotes the iteration number, and η is a learning rate parameter. We shall
discuss the choice of value for η shortly. The value of w is initialized to some starting
vector w(0). For the case of the sum-of-squares error function (3.12), this gives

w(τ +1) = w(τ ) + η(tn − w(τ )Tφn)φn

(3.23)

where φn = φ(xn). This is known as least-mean-squares or the LMS algorithm.
The value of η needs to be chosen with care to ensure that the algorithm converges
(Bishop and Nabney, 2008).

w(τ +1) = w(τ ) − η∇En

3.1.4 Regularized least squares
In Section 1.1, we introduced the idea of adding a regularization term to an
error function in order to control over-ﬁtting, so that the total error function to be
minimized takes the form

ED(w) + λEW (w)

(3.24)
where λ is the regularization coefﬁcient that controls the relative importance of the
data-dependent error ED(w) and the regularization term EW (w). One of the sim-
plest forms of regularizer is given by the sum-of-squares of the weight vector ele-
ments

If we also consider the sum-of-squares error function given by

EW (w) =

wTw.

then the total error function becomes

This particular choice of regularizer is known in the machine learning literature as
weight decay because in sequential learning algorithms, it encourages weight values
to decay towards zero, unless supported by the data. In statistics, it provides an ex-
ample of a parameter shrinkage method because it shrinks parameter values towards

zero. It has the advantage that the error function remains a quadratic function of
w, and so its exact minimizer can be found in closed form. Speciﬁcally, setting the
gradient of (3.27) with respect to w to zero, and solving for w as before, we obtain

w =

λI + ΦTΦ

(3.28)

This represents a simple extension of the least-squares solution (3.15).

A more general regularizer is sometimes used, for which the regularized error

where q = 2 corresponds to the quadratic regularizer (3.27). Figure 3.3 shows con-
tours of the regularization function for different values of q.

The case of q = 1 is know as the lasso in the statistics literature (Tibshirani,
It has the property that if λ is sufﬁciently large, some of the coefﬁcients
1996).
wj are driven to zero, leading to a sparse model in which the corresponding basis
functions play no role. To see this, we ﬁrst note that minimizing (3.29) is equivalent
to minimizing the unregularized sum-of-squares error (3.12) subject to the constraint

|wj|q (cid:1) η

j=1

for an appropriate value of the parameter η, where the two approaches can be related
using Lagrange multipliers. The origin of the sparsity can be seen from Figure 3.4,
which shows that the minimum of the error function, subject to the constraint (3.30).
As λ is increased, so an increasing number of parameters are driven to zero.

Regularization allows complex models to be trained on data sets of limited size
without severe over-ﬁtting, essentially by limiting the effective model complexity.
However, the problem of determining the optimal model complexity is then shifted
from one of ﬁnding the appropriate number of basis functions to one of determining
a suitable value of the regularization coefﬁcient λ. We shall return to the issue of
model complexity later in this chapter.

3.1.5 Multiple outputs
So far, we have considered the case of a single target variable t. In some applica-
tions, we may wish to predict K > 1 target variables, which we denote collectively
by the target vector t. This could be done by introducing a different set of basis func-
tions for each component of t, leading to multiple, independent regression problems.
However, a more interesting, and more common, approach is to use the same set of
basis functions to model all of the components of the target vector so that

y(x, w) = WTφ(x)

(3.31)
where y is a K-dimensional column vector, W is an M × K matrix of parameters,
and φ(x) is an M-dimensional column vector with elements φj(x), with φ0(x) = 1
as before. Suppose we take the conditional distribution of the target vector to be an
isotropic Gaussian of the form

p(t|x, W, β) = N (t|WTφ(x), β

−1I).

(3.32)

If we have a set of observations t1, . . . , tN , we can combine these into a matrix T
of size N × K such that the nth row is given by tT
n. Similarly, we can combine the
input vectors x1, . . . , xN into a matrix X. The log likelihood function is then given
by

ln p(T|X, W, β) =

Thus the solution to the regression problem decouples between the different target
†
variables, and we need only compute a single pseudo-inverse matrix Φ
, which is
shared by all of the vectors wk.

The extension to general Gaussian noise distributions having arbitrary covari-
ance matrices is straightforward. Again, this leads to a decoupling into K inde-
pendent regression problems. This result is unsurprising because the parameters W
deﬁne only the mean of the Gaussian noise distribution, and we know from Sec-
tion 2.3.4 that the maximum likelihood solution for the mean of a multivariate Gaus-
sian is independent of the covariance. From now on, we shall therefore consider a
single target variable t for simplicity.

3.2. The Bias-Variance Decomposition

So far in our discussion of linear models for regression, we have assumed that the
form and number of basis functions are both ﬁxed. As we have seen in Chapter 1,
the use of maximum likelihood, or equivalently least squares, can lead to severe
over-ﬁtting if complex models are trained using data sets of limited size. However,
limiting the number of basis functions in order to avoid over-ﬁtting has the side
effect of limiting the ﬂexibility of the model to capture interesting and important
trends in the data. Although the introduction of regularization terms can control
over-ﬁtting for models with many parameters, this raises the question of how to
determine a suitable value for the regularization coefﬁcient λ. Seeking the solution
that minimizes the regularized error function with respect to both the weight vector
w and the regularization coefﬁcient λ is clearly not the right approach since this
leads to the unregularized solution with λ = 0.

As we have seen in earlier chapters, the phenomenon of over-ﬁtting is really an
unfortunate property of maximum likelihood and does not arise when we marginalize
over parameters in a Bayesian setting. In this chapter, we shall consider the Bayesian
view of model complexity in some depth. Before doing so, however, it is instructive
to consider a frequentist viewpoint of the model complexity issue, known as the bias-
variance trade-off. Although we shall introduce this concept in the context of linear
basis function models, where it is easy to illustrate the ideas using simple examples,
the discussion has more general applicability.

In Section 1.5.5, when we discussed decision theory for regression problems,
we considered various loss functions each of which leads to a corresponding optimal
prediction once we are given the conditional distribution p(t|x). A popular choice is

148

3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION

the squared loss function, for which the optimal prediction is given by the conditional
expectation, which we denote by h(x) and which is given by

h(x) = E[t|x] =

tp(t|x) dt.

(3.36)

At this point, it is worth distinguishing between the squared loss function arising
from decision theory and the sum-of-squares error function that arose in the maxi-
mum likelihood estimation of model parameters. We might use more sophisticated
techniques than least squares, for example regularization or a fully Bayesian ap-
proach, to determine the conditional distribution p(t|x). These can all be combined
with the squared loss function for the purpose of making predictions.

We showed in Section 1.5.5 that the expected squared loss can be written in the

(cid:6)

(cid:6)

(cid:6)

form

E[L] =

{y(x) − h(x)}2

p(x) dx +

{h(x) − t}2p(x, t) dx dt.

(3.37)

Recall that the second term, which is independent of y(x), arises from the intrinsic
noise on the data and represents the minimum achievable value of the expected loss.
The ﬁrst term depends on our choice for the function y(x), and we will seek a so-
lution for y(x) which makes this term a minimum. Because it is nonnegative, the
smallest that we can hope to make this term is zero. If we had an unlimited supply of
data (and unlimited computational resources), we could in principle ﬁnd the regres-
sion function h(x) to any desired degree of accuracy, and this would represent the
optimal choice for y(x). However, in practice we have a data set D containing only
a ﬁnite number N of data points, and consequently we do not know the regression
function h(x) exactly.

If we model the h(x) using a parametric function y(x, w) governed by a pa-
rameter vector w, then from a Bayesian perspective the uncertainty in our model is
expressed through a posterior distribution over w. A frequentist treatment, however,
involves making a point estimate of w based on the data set D, and tries instead
to interpret the uncertainty of this estimate through the following thought experi-
ment. Suppose we had a large number of data sets each of size N and each drawn
independently from the distribution p(t, x). For any given data set D, we can run
our learning algorithm and obtain a prediction function y(x;D). Different data sets
from the ensemble will give different functions and consequently different values of
the squared loss. The performance of a particular learning algorithm is then assessed
by taking the average over this ensemble of data sets.
D takes the form
(3.38)
Because this quantity will be dependent on the particular data set D, we take its aver-
age over the ensemble of data sets. If we add and subtract the quantity ED[y(x;D)]

Consider the integrand of the ﬁrst term in (3.37), which for a particular data set

inside the braces, and then expand, we obtain

{y(x;D) − ED[y(x;D)] + ED[y(x;D)] − h(x)}2
= {y(x;D) − ED[y(x;D)]}2 + {ED[y(x;D)] − h(x)}2
+2{y(x;D) − ED[y(x;D)]}{ED[y(x;D)] − h(x)}.

(3.39)
We now take the expectation of this expression with respect to D and note that the
ﬁnal term will vanish, giving

variance

We see that the expected squared difference between y(x;D) and the regression
function h(x) can be expressed as the sum of two terms. The ﬁrst term, called the
squared bias, represents the extent to which the average prediction over all data sets
differs from the desired regression function. The second term, called the variance,
measures the extent to which the solutions for individual data sets vary around their
average, and hence this measures the extent to which the function y(x;D) is sensitive
to the particular choice of data set. We shall provide some intuition to support these
deﬁnitions shortly when we consider a simple example.

So far, we have considered a single input value x. If we substitute this expansion
back into (3.37), we obtain the following decomposition of the expected squared loss

expected loss = (bias)2 + variance + noise

where

(bias)2 =

and the bias and variance terms now refer to integrated quantities.

Our goal is to minimize the expected loss, which we have decomposed into the
sum of a (squared) bias, a variance, and a constant noise term. As we shall see, there
is a trade-off between bias and variance, with very ﬂexible models having low bias
and high variance, and relatively rigid models having high bias and low variance.
The model with the optimal predictive capability is the one that leads to the best
balance between bias and variance. This is illustrated by considering the sinusoidal
data set from Chapter 1. Here we generate 100 data sets, each containing N = 25
data points, independently from the sinusoidal curve h(x) = sin(2πx). The data
sets are indexed by l = 1, . . . , L, where L = 100, and for each data set D(l) we

ﬁt a model with 24 Gaussian basis functions by minimizing the regularized error
function (3.27) to give a prediction function y(l)(x) as shown in Figure 3.5. The
top row corresponds to a large value of the regularization coefﬁcient λ that gives low
variance (because the red curves in the left plot look similar) but high bias (because
the two curves in the right plot are very different). Conversely on the bottom row, for
which λ is small, there is large variance (shown by the high variability between the
red curves in the left plot) but low bias (shown by the good ﬁt between the average
model ﬁt and the original sinusoidal function). Note that the result of averaging many
solutions for the complex model with M = 25 is a very good ﬁt to the regression
function, which suggests that averaging may be a beneﬁcial procedure. Indeed, a
weighted averaging of multiple solutions lies at the heart of a Bayesian approach,
although the averaging is with respect to the posterior distribution of parameters, not
with respect to multiple data sets.

We can also examine the bias-variance trade-off quantitatively for this example.

data set leading to large variance. Conversely, a large value of λ pulls the weight
parameters towards zero leading to large bias.

Although the bias-variance decomposition may provide some interesting in-
sights into the model complexity issue from a frequentist perspective, it is of lim-
ited practical value, because the bias-variance decomposition is based on averages
with respect to ensembles of data sets, whereas in practice we have only the single
observed data set. If we had a large number of independent training sets of a given
size, we would be better off combining them into a single large training set, which
of course would reduce the level of over-ﬁtting for a given model complexity.

Given these limitations, we turn in the next section to a Bayesian treatment of
linear basis function models, which not only provides powerful insights into the
issues of over-ﬁtting but which also leads to practical techniques for addressing the
question model complexity.

3.3. Bayesian Linear Regression

In our discussion of maximum likelihood for setting the parameters of a linear re-
gression model, we have seen that the effective model complexity, governed by the
number of basis functions, needs to be controlled according to the size of the data
set. Adding a regularization term to the log likelihood function means the effective
model complexity can then be controlled by the value of the regularization coefﬁ-
cient, although the choice of the number and form of the basis functions is of course
still important in determining the overall behaviour of the model.

This leaves the issue of deciding the appropriate model complexity for the par-
ticular problem, which cannot be decided simply by maximizing the likelihood func-
tion, because this always leads to excessively complex models and over-ﬁtting. In-
dependent hold-out data can be used to determine model complexity, as discussed
in Section 1.3, but this can be both computationally expensive and wasteful of valu-
able data. We therefore turn to a Bayesian treatment of linear regression, which will
avoid the over-ﬁtting problem of maximum likelihood, and which will also lead to
automatic methods of determining model complexity using the training data alone.
Again, for simplicity we will focus on the case of a single target variable t. Ex-
tension to multiple target variables is straightforward and follows the discussion of
Section 3.1.5.

3.3.1 Parameter distribution
We begin our discussion of the Bayesian treatment of linear regression by in-
troducing a prior probability distribution over the model parameters w. For the mo-
ment, we shall treat the noise precision parameter β as a known constant. First note
that the likelihood function p(t|w) deﬁned by (3.10) is the exponential of a quadratic
function of w. The corresponding conjugate prior is therefore given by a Gaussian
distribution of the form

p(w) = N (w|m0, S0)

(3.48)

having mean m0 and covariance S0.

Exercise 3.7

Exercise 3.8

3.3. Bayesian Linear Regression

153

Next we compute the posterior distribution, which is proportional to the product
of the likelihood function and the prior. Due to the choice of a conjugate Gaus-
sian prior distribution, the posterior will also be Gaussian. We can evaluate this
distribution by the usual procedure of completing the square in the exponential, and
then ﬁnding the normalization coefﬁcient using the standard result for a normalized
Gaussian. However, we have already done the necessary work in deriving the gen-
eral result (2.116), which allows us to write down the posterior distribution directly
in the form

If we consider an inﬁnitely broad prior S0 = α
of the posterior distribution reduces to the maximum likelihood value wML given
by (3.15). Similarly, if N = 0, then the posterior distribution reverts to the prior.
Furthermore, if data points arrive sequentially, then the posterior distribution at any
stage acts as the prior distribution for the subsequent data point, such that the new
posterior distribution is again given by (3.49).

For the remainder of this chapter, we shall consider a particular form of Gaus-
sian prior in order to simplify the treatment. Speciﬁcally, we consider a zero-mean
isotropic Gaussian governed by a single precision parameter α so that

p(w|α) = N (w|0, α

and the corresponding posterior distribution over w is then given by (3.49) with

Maximization of this posterior distribution with respect to w is therefore equiva-
lent to the minimization of the sum-of-squares error function with the addition of a
quadratic regularization term, corresponding to (3.27) with λ = α/β.

We can illustrate Bayesian learning in a linear basis function model, as well as
the sequential update of a posterior distribution, using a simple example involving
straight-line ﬁtting. Consider a single input variable x, a single target variable t and

N(cid:2)

n=1

154

3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION

a linear model of the form y(x, w) = w0 + w1x. Because this has just two adap-
tive parameters, we can plot the prior and posterior distributions directly in parameter
space. We generate synthetic data from the function f(x, a) = a0 + a1x with param-
eter values a0 = −0.3 and a1 = 0.5 by ﬁrst choosing values of xn from the uniform
distribution U(x|−1, 1), then evaluating f(xn, a), and ﬁnally adding Gaussian noise
with standard deviation of 0.2 to obtain the target values tn. Our goal is to recover
the values of a0 and a1 from such data, and we will explore the dependence on the
size of the data set. We assume here that the noise variance is known and hence we
set the precision parameter to its true value β = (1/0.2)2 = 25. Similarly, we ﬁx
the parameter α to 2.0. We shall shortly discuss strategies for determining α and
β from the training data. Figure 3.7 shows the results of Bayesian learning in this
model as the size of the data set is increased and demonstrates the sequential nature
of Bayesian learning in which the current posterior distribution forms the prior when
a new data point is observed. It is worth taking time to study this ﬁgure in detail as
it illustrates several important aspects of Bayesian inference. The ﬁrst row of this
ﬁgure corresponds to the situation before any data points are observed and shows a
plot of the prior distribution in w space together with six samples of the function
y(x, w) in which the values of w are drawn from the prior. In the second row, we
see the situation after observing a single data point. The location (x, t) of the data
point is shown by a blue circle in the right-hand column. In the left-hand column is a
plot of the likelihood function p(t|x, w) for this data point as a function of w. Note
that the likelihood function provides a soft constraint that the line must pass close to
the data point, where close is determined by the noise precision β. For comparison,
the true parameter values a0 = −0.3 and a1 = 0.5 used to generate the data set
are shown by a white cross in the plots in the left column of Figure 3.7. When we
multiply this likelihood function by the prior from the top row, and normalize, we
obtain the posterior distribution shown in the middle plot on the second row. Sam-
ples of the regression function y(x, w) obtained by drawing samples of w from this
posterior distribution are shown in the right-hand plot. Note that these sample lines
all pass close to the data point. The third row of this ﬁgure shows the effect of ob-
serving a second data point, again shown by a blue circle in the plot in the right-hand
column. The corresponding likelihood function for this second data point alone is
shown in the left plot. When we multiply this likelihood function by the posterior
distribution from the second row, we obtain the posterior distribution shown in the
middle plot of the third row. Note that this is exactly the same posterior distribution
as would be obtained by combining the original prior with the likelihood function
for the two data points. This posterior has now been inﬂuenced by two data points,
and because two points are sufﬁcient to deﬁne a line this already gives a relatively
compact posterior distribution. Samples from this posterior distribution give rise to
the functions shown in red in the third column, and we see that these functions pass
close to both of the data points. The fourth row shows the effect of observing a total
of 20 data points. The left-hand plot shows the likelihood function for the 20th data
point alone, and the middle plot shows the resulting posterior distribution that has
now absorbed information from all 20 observations. Note how the posterior is much
sharper than in the third row. In the limit of an inﬁnite number of data points, the

posterior distribution would become a delta function centred on the true parameter
values, shown by the white cross.

Other forms of prior over the parameters can be considered. For instance, we

can generalize the Gaussian prior to give

in which q = 2 corresponds to the Gaussian distribution, and only in this case is the
prior conjugate to the likelihood function (3.10). Finding the maximum of the poste-
rior distribution over w corresponds to minimization of the regularized error function
(3.29). In the case of the Gaussian prior, the mode of the posterior distribution was
equal to the mean, although this will no longer hold if q (cid:9)= 2.

In practice, we are not usually interested in the value of w itself but rather in
making predictions of t for new values of x. This requires that we evaluate the
predictive distribution deﬁned by
p(t|t, α, β) =

p(t|w, β)p(w|t, α, β) dw

(3.57)

(cid:6)

Exercise 3.10

Exercise 3.11

in which t is the vector of target values from the training set, and we have omitted the
corresponding input vectors from the right-hand side of the conditioning statements
to simplify the notation. The conditional distribution p(t|x, w, β) of the target vari-
able is given by (3.8), and the posterior weight distribution is given by (3.49). We
see that (3.57) involves the convolution of two Gaussian distributions, and so making
use of the result (2.115) from Section 8.1.4, we see that the predictive distribution
takes the form

where the variance σ2

p(t|x, t, α, β) = N (t|mT
N (x) of the predictive distribution is given by

N φ(x), σ2

N (x))

(3.58)

(3.59)

σ2
N (x) =

+ φ(x)TSN φ(x).

The ﬁrst term in (3.59) represents the noise on the data whereas the second term
reﬂects the uncertainty associated with the parameters w. Because the noise process
and the distribution of w are independent Gaussians, their variances are additive.
Note that, as additional data points are observed, the posterior distribution becomes
N +1(x) (cid:1)
narrower. As a consequence it can be shown (Qazaz et al., 1997) that σ2
N (x). In the limit N → ∞, the second term in (3.59) goes to zero, and the variance
σ2
of the predictive distribution arises solely from the additive noise governed by the
parameter β.

As an illustration of the predictive distribution for Bayesian linear regression
models, let us return to the synthetic sinusoidal data set of Section 1.1. In Figure 3.8,

we ﬁt a model comprising a linear combination of Gaussian basis functions to data
sets of various sizes and then look at the corresponding posterior distributions. Here
the green curves correspond to the function sin(2πx) from which the data points
were generated (with the addition of Gaussian noise). Data sets of size N = 1,
N = 2, N = 4, and N = 25 are shown in the four plots by the blue circles. For
each plot, the red curve shows the mean of the corresponding Gaussian predictive
distribution, and the red shaded region spans one standard deviation either side of
the mean. Note that the predictive uncertainty depends on x and is smallest in the
neighbourhood of the data points. Also note that the level of uncertainty decreases
as more data points are observed.

The plots in Figure 3.8 only show the point-wise predictive variance as a func-
tion of x. In order to gain insight into the covariance between the predictions at
different values of x, we can draw samples from the posterior distribution over w,
and then plot the corresponding functions y(x, w), as shown in Figure 3.9.

the model becomes very conﬁdent in its predictions when extrapolating outside the
region occupied by the basis functions, which is generally an undesirable behaviour.
This problem can be avoided by adopting an alternative Bayesian approach to re-
gression known as a Gaussian process.

Note that, if both w and β are treated as unknown, then we can introduce a
conjugate prior distribution p(w, β) that, from the discussion in Section 2.3.6, will
be given by a Gaussian-gamma distribution (Denison et al., 2002). In this case, the
predictive distribution is a Student’s t-distribution.

3.3.3 Equivalent kernel
The posterior mean solution (3.53) for the linear basis function model has an in-
teresting interpretation that will set the stage for kernel methods, including Gaussian
processes. If we substitute (3.53) into the expression (3.3), we see that the predictive
mean can be written in the form

N φ(x) = βφ(x)TSN ΦTt =

βφ(x)TSN φ(xn)tn

(3.60)

N(cid:2)

where SN is deﬁned by (3.51). Thus the mean of the predictive distribution at a point
x is given by a linear combination of the training set target variables tn, so that we
can write

N(cid:2)

y(x, mN) =

k(x, xn)tn

where the function

n=1

k(x, x(cid:4)) = βφ(x)TSN φ(x(cid:4))

(3.61)

(3.62)

is known as the smoother matrix or the equivalent kernel. Regression functions, such
as this, which make predictions by taking linear combinations of the training set
target values are known as linear smoothers. Note that the equivalent kernel depends
on the input values xn from the data set because these appear in the deﬁnition of
SN . The equivalent kernel is illustrated for the case of Gaussian basis functions in
(cid:4)) have been plotted as a function of
Figure 3.10 in which the kernel functions k(x, x
(cid:4)
for three different values of x. We see that they are localized around x, and so the
x
mean of the predictive distribution at x, given by y(x, mN), is obtained by forming
a weighted combination of the target values in which data points close to x are given
higher weight than points further removed from x. Intuitively, it seems reasonable
that we should weight local evidence more strongly than distant evidence. Note that
this localization property holds not only for the localized Gaussian basis functions
but also for the nonlocal polynomial and sigmoidal basis functions, as illustrated in
Figure 3.11.

Further insight into the role of the equivalent kernel can be obtained by consid-

ering the covariance between y(x) and y(x(cid:4)), which is given by
cov[y(x), y(x(cid:4))] = cov[φ(x)Tw, wTφ(x(cid:4))]

= φ(x)TSN φ(x(cid:4)) = β

−1k(x, x(cid:4))

(3.63)

where we have made use of (3.49) and (3.62). From the form of the equivalent
kernel, we see that the predictive mean at nearby points will be highly correlated,
whereas for more distant pairs of points the correlation will be smaller.

The predictive distribution shown in Figure 3.8 allows us to visualize the point-
wise uncertainty in the predictions, governed by (3.59). However, by drawing sam-
ples from the posterior distribution over w, and plotting the corresponding model
functions y(x, w) as in Figure 3.9, we are visualizing the joint uncertainty in the
posterior distribution between the y values at two (or more) x values, as governed by
the equivalent kernel.

The formulation of linear regression in terms of a kernel function suggests an
alternative approach to regression as follows. Instead of introducing a set of basis
functions, which implicitly determines an equivalent kernel, we can instead deﬁne
a localized kernel directly and use this to make predictions for new input vectors x,
given the observed training set. This leads to a practical framework for regression
(and classiﬁcation) called Gaussian processes, which will be discussed in detail in
Section 6.4.

We have seen that the effective kernel deﬁnes the weights by which the training
set target values are combined in order to make a prediction at a new value of x, and
it can be shown that these weights sum to one, in other words

N(cid:2)

k(x, xn) = 1

(3.64)

Exercise 3.14

n=1

by noting that the summation is equivalent to considering the predictive mean(cid:1)y(x)

for all values of x. This intuitively pleasing result can easily be proven informally

for a set of target data in which tn = 1 for all n. Provided the basis functions are
linearly independent, that there are more data points than basis functions, and that
one of the basis functions is constant (corresponding to the bias parameter), then it is
clear that we can ﬁt the training data exactly and hence that the predictive mean will

be simply(cid:1)y(x) = 1, from which we obtain (3.64). Note that the kernel function can

be negative as well as positive, so although it satisﬁes a summation constraint, the
corresponding predictions are not necessarily convex combinations of the training
set target variables.

Finally, we note that the equivalent kernel (3.62) satisﬁes an important property
shared by kernel functions in general, namely that it can be expressed in the form an
inner product with respect to a vector ψ(x) of nonlinear functions, so that

k(x, z) = ψ(x)Tψ(z)

3.4. Bayesian Model Comparison

In Chapter 1, we highlighted the problem of over-ﬁtting as well as the use of cross-
validation as a technique for setting the values of regularization parameters or for
choosing between alternative models. Here we consider the problem of model se-
lection from a Bayesian perspective.
In this section, our discussion will be very
general, and then in Section 3.5 we shall see how these ideas can be applied to the
determination of regularization parameters in linear regression.

As we shall see, the over-ﬁtting associated with maximum likelihood can be
avoided by marginalizing (summing or integrating) over the model parameters in-
stead of making point estimates of their values. Models can then be compared di-
rectly on the training data, without the need for a validation set. This allows all
available data to be used for training and avoids the multiple training runs for each
model associated with cross-validation. It also allows multiple complexity parame-
ters to be determined simultaneously as part of the training process. For example,
in Chapter 7 we shall introduce the relevance vector machine, which is a Bayesian
model having one complexity parameter for every training data point.

Section 1.5.4

The Bayesian view of model comparison simply involves the use of probabilities
to represent uncertainty in the choice of model, along with a consistent application
of the sum and product rules of probability. Suppose we wish to compare a set of L
models {Mi} where i = 1, . . . , L. Here a model refers to a probability distribution
over the observed data D. In the case of the polynomial curve-ﬁtting problem, the
distribution is deﬁned over the set of target values t, while the set of input values X
is assumed to be known. Other types of model deﬁne a joint distributions over X
and t. We shall suppose that the data is generated from one of these models but we
are uncertain which one. Our uncertainty is expressed through a prior probability
distribution p(Mi). Given a training set D, we then wish to evaluate the posterior
distribution

(3.66)
The prior allows us to express a preference for different models. Let us simply
assume that all models are given equal prior probability. The interesting term is
the model evidence p(D|Mi) which expresses the preference shown by the data for

p(Mi|D) ∝ p(Mi)p(D|Mi).

162

3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION

different models, and we shall examine this term in more detail shortly. The model
evidence is sometimes also called the marginal likelihood because it can be viewed
as a likelihood function over the space of models, in which the parameters have been
marginalized out. The ratio of model evidences p(D|Mi)/p(D|Mj) for two models
is known as a Bayes factor (Kass and Raftery, 1995).

Once we know the posterior distribution over models, the predictive distribution

is given, from the sum and product rules, by

L(cid:2)

(cid:6)

p(t|x,D) =

p(t|x,Mi,D)p(Mi|D).

(3.67)

i=1

This is an example of a mixture distribution in which the overall predictive distribu-
tion is obtained by averaging the predictive distributions p(t|x,Mi,D) of individual
models, weighted by the posterior probabilities p(Mi|D) of those models. For in-
stance, if we have two models that are a-posteriori equally likely and one predicts
a narrow distribution around t = a while the other predicts a narrow distribution
around t = b, the overall predictive distribution will be a bimodal distribution with
modes at t = a and t = b, not a single model at t = (a + b)/2.

A simple approximation to model averaging is to use the single most probable

model alone to make predictions. This is known as model selection.

For a model governed by a set of parameters w, the model evidence is given,

from the sum and product rules of probability, by

p(D|Mi) =

p(D|w,Mi)p(w|Mi) dw.

(3.68)

Chapter 11

From a sampling perspective, the marginal likelihood can be viewed as the proba-
bility of generating the data set D from a model whose parameters are sampled at
random from the prior. It is also interesting to note that the evidence is precisely the
normalizing term that appears in the denominator in Bayes’ theorem when evaluating
the posterior distribution over parameters because

p(w|D,Mi) = p(D|w,Mi)p(w|Mi)

p(D|Mi)

.

(3.69)

We can obtain some insight into the model evidence by making a simple approx-
imation to the integral over parameters. Consider ﬁrst the case of a model having a
single parameter w. The posterior distribution over parameters is proportional to
p(D|w)p(w), where we omit the dependence on the model Mi to keep the notation
uncluttered. If we assume that the posterior distribution is sharply peaked around the
most probable value wMAP, with width ∆wposterior, then we can approximate the in-
tegral by the value of the integrand at its maximum times the width of the peak. If we
further assume that the prior is ﬂat with width ∆wprior so that p(w) = 1/∆wprior,
then we have

(cid:6)

p(D) =

p(D|w)p(w) dw (cid:7) p(D|wMAP)

∆wposterior

(3.70)

the model evidence if we assume that
the posterior distribution over parame-
ters is sharply peaked around its mode
wMAP.

(3.71)

This approximation is illustrated in Figure 3.12. The ﬁrst term represents the ﬁt to
the data given by the most probable parameter values, and for a ﬂat prior this would
correspond to the log likelihood. The second term penalizes the model according to
its complexity. Because ∆wposterior < ∆wprior this term is negative, and it increases
in magnitude as the ratio ∆wposterior/∆wprior gets smaller. Thus, if parameters are
ﬁnely tuned to the data in the posterior distribution, then the penalty term is large.

For a model having a set of M parameters, we can make a similar approximation
for each parameter in turn. Assuming that all parameters have the same ratio of
∆wposterior/∆wprior, we obtain

(cid:15)

(cid:16)

ln p(D) (cid:7) ln p(D|wMAP) + M ln

∆wposterior

.

(3.72)

Section 4.4.1

Thus, in this very simple approximation, the size of the complexity penalty increases
linearly with the number M of adaptive parameters in the model. As we increase
the complexity of the model, the ﬁrst term will typically decrease, because a more
complex model is better able to ﬁt the data, whereas the second term will increase
due to the dependence on M. The optimal model complexity, as determined by
the maximum evidence, will be given by a trade-off between these two competing
terms. We shall later develop a more reﬁned version of this approximation, based on
a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution.

We can gain further insight into Bayesian model comparison and understand
how the marginal likelihood can favour models of intermediate complexity by con-
sidering Figure 3.13. Here the horizontal axis is a one-dimensional representation
of the space of possible data sets, so that each point on this axis corresponds to a
speciﬁc data set. We now consider three models M1, M2 and M3 of successively
increasing complexity. Imagine running these models generatively to produce exam-
ple data sets, and then looking at the distribution of data sets that result. Any given

model can generate a variety of different data sets since the parameters are governed
by a prior probability distribution, and for any choice of the parameters there may
be random noise on the target variables. To generate a particular data set from a spe-
ciﬁc model, we ﬁrst choose the values of the parameters from their prior distribution
p(w), and then for these parameter values we sample the data from p(D|w). A sim-
ple model (for example, based on a ﬁrst order polynomial) has little variability and
so will generate data sets that are fairly similar to each other. Its distribution p(D)
is therefore conﬁned to a relatively small region of the horizontal axis. By contrast,
a complex model (such as a ninth order polynomial) can generate a great variety of
different data sets, and so its distribution p(D) is spread over a large region of the
space of data sets. Because the distributions p(D|Mi) are normalized, we see that
the particular data set D0 can have the highest value of the evidence for the model
of intermediate complexity. Essentially, the simpler model cannot ﬁt the data well,
whereas the more complex model spreads its predictive probability over too broad a
range of data sets and so assigns relatively small probability to any one of them.

Implicit in the Bayesian model comparison framework is the assumption that
the true distribution from which the data are generated is contained within the set of
models under consideration. Provided this is so, we can show that Bayesian model
comparison will on average favour the correct model. To see this, consider two
models M1 and M2 in which the truth corresponds to M1. For a given ﬁnite data
set, it is possible for the Bayes factor to be larger for the incorrect model. However, if
Bayes factor in the form (cid:6)
we average the Bayes factor over the distribution of data sets, we obtain the expected

(3.73)

p(D|M1) ln p(D|M1)

Section 1.6.1

where the average has been taken with respect to the true distribution of the data.
This quantity is an example of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and satisﬁes the prop-
erty of always being positive unless the two distributions are equal in which case it
is zero. Thus on average the Bayes factor will always favour the correct model.

We have seen that the Bayesian framework avoids the problem of over-ﬁtting
and allows models to be compared on the basis of the training data alone. However,

3.5. The Evidence Approximation

165

a Bayesian approach, like any approach to pattern recognition, needs to make as-
sumptions about the form of the model, and if these are invalid then the results can
be misleading. In particular, we see from Figure 3.12 that the model evidence can
be sensitive to many aspects of the prior, such as the behaviour in the tails. Indeed,
the evidence is not deﬁned if the prior is improper, as can be seen by noting that
an improper prior has an arbitrary scaling factor (in other words, the normalization
coefﬁcient is not deﬁned because the distribution cannot be normalized). If we con-
sider a proper prior and then take a suitable limit in order to obtain an improper prior
(for example, a Gaussian prior in which we take the limit of inﬁnite variance) then
the evidence will go to zero, as can be seen from (3.70) and Figure 3.12. It may,
however, be possible to consider the evidence ratio between two models ﬁrst and
then take a limit to obtain a meaningful answer.

In a practical application, therefore, it will be wise to keep aside an independent

test set of data on which to evaluate the overall performance of the ﬁnal system.

3.5. The Evidence Approximation

In a fully Bayesian treatment of the linear basis function model, we would intro-
duce prior distributions over the hyperparameters α and β and make predictions by
marginalizing with respect to these hyperparameters as well as with respect to the
parameters w. However, although we can integrate analytically over either w or
over the hyperparameters, the complete marginalization over all of these variables
is analytically intractable. Here we discuss an approximation in which we set the
hyperparameters to speciﬁc values determined by maximizing the marginal likeli-
hood function obtained by ﬁrst integrating over the parameters w. This framework
is known in the statistics literature as empirical Bayes (Bernardo and Smith, 1994;
Gelman et al., 2004), or type 2 maximum likelihood (Berger, 1985), or generalized
maximum likelihood (Wahba, 1975), and in the machine learning literature is also
called the evidence approximation (Gull, 1989; MacKay, 1992a).

If we introduce hyperpriors over α and β, the predictive distribution is obtained

by marginalizing over w, α and β so that

(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)

p(t|t) =

p(t|w, β)p(w|t, α, β)p(α, β|t) dw dα dβ

(3.74)
where p(t|w, β) is given by (3.8) and p(w|t, α, β) is given by (3.49) with mN and
SN deﬁned by (3.53) and (3.54) respectively. Here we have omitted the dependence
on the input variable x to keep the notation uncluttered. If the posterior distribution

p(α, β|t) is sharply peaked around values(cid:1)α and(cid:1)β, then the predictive distribution is
obtained simply by marginalizing over w in which α and β are ﬁxed to the values(cid:1)α
and(cid:1)β, so that

p(t|t) (cid:7) p(t|t,(cid:1)α,(cid:1)β) =

p(t|w,(cid:1)β)p(w|t,(cid:1)α,(cid:1)β) dw.

(3.75)

(cid:6)

166

3. LINEAR MODELS FOR REGRESSION

From Bayes’ theorem, the posterior distribution for α and β is given by

If the prior is relatively ﬂat, then in the evidence framework the values of (cid:1)α and
(cid:1)β are obtained by maximizing the marginal likelihood function p(t|α, β). We shall

p(α, β|t) ∝ p(t|α, β)p(α, β).

(3.76)

proceed by evaluating the marginal likelihood for the linear basis function model and
then ﬁnding its maxima. This will allow us to determine values for these hyperpa-
rameters from the training data alone, without recourse to cross-validation. Recall
that the ratio α/β is analogous to a regularization parameter.

As an aside it is worth noting that, if we deﬁne conjugate (Gamma) prior distri-
butions over α and β, then the marginalization over these hyperparameters in (3.74)
can be performed analytically to give a Student’s t-distribution over w (see Sec-
tion 2.3.7). Although the resulting integral over w is no longer analytically tractable,
it might be thought that approximating this integral, for example using the Laplace
approximation discussed (Section 4.4) which is based on a local Gaussian approxi-
mation centred on the mode of the posterior distribution, might provide a practical
alternative to the evidence framework (Buntine and Weigend, 1991). However, the
integrand as a function of w typically has a strongly skewed mode so that the Laplace
approximation fails to capture the bulk of the probability mass, leading to poorer re-
sults than those obtained by maximizing the evidence (MacKay, 1999).

Returning to the evidence framework, we note that there are two approaches that
we can take to the maximization of the log evidence. We can evaluate the evidence
function analytically and then set its derivative equal to zero to obtain re-estimation
equations for α and β, which we shall do in Section 3.5.2. Alternatively we use a
technique called the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which will be dis-
cussed in Section 9.3.4 where we shall also show that these two approaches converge
to the same solution.

The marginal likelihood function p(t|α, β) is obtained by integrating over the

One way to evaluate this integral is to make use once again of the result (2.115)
for the conditional distribution in a linear-Gaussian model. Here we shall evaluate
the integral instead by completing the square in the exponent and making use of the
standard form for the normalization coefﬁcient of a Gaussian.

From (3.11), (3.12), and (3.52), we can write the evidence function in the form

which is the required expression for the evidence function.

Returning to the polynomial regression problem, we can plot the model evidence
against the order of the polynomial, as shown in Figure 3.14. Here we have assumed
a prior of the form (1.65) with the parameter α ﬁxed at α = 5 × 10−3. The form
of this plot is very instructive. Referring back to Figure 1.4, we see that the M = 0
polynomial has very poor ﬁt to the data and consequently gives a relatively low value

for the evidence. Going to the M = 1 polynomial greatly improves the data ﬁt, and
hence the evidence is signiﬁcantly higher. However, in going to M = 2, the data
ﬁt is improved only very marginally, due to the fact that the underlying sinusoidal
function from which the data is generated is an odd function and so has no even terms
in a polynomial expansion. Indeed, Figure 1.5 shows that the residual data error is
reduced only slightly in going from M = 1 to M = 2. Because this richer model
suffers a greater complexity penalty, the evidence actually falls in going from M = 1
to M = 2. When we go to M = 3 we obtain a signiﬁcant further improvement in
data ﬁt, as seen in Figure 1.4, and so the evidence is increased again, giving the
highest overall evidence for any of the polynomials. Further increases in the value
of M produce only small improvements in the ﬁt to the data but suffer increasing
complexity penalty, leading overall to a decrease in the evidence values. Looking
again at Figure 1.5, we see that the generalization error is roughly constant between
M = 3 and M = 8, and it would be difﬁcult to choose between these models on
the basis of this plot alone. The evidence values, however, show a clear preference
for M = 3, since this is the simplest model which gives a good explanation for the
observed data.

3.5.2 Maximizing the evidence function
Let us ﬁrst consider the maximization of p(t|α, β) with respect to α. This can

be done by ﬁrst deﬁning the following eigenvector equation

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

(3.87)
(cid:2)
From (3.81), it then follows that A has eigenvalues α + λi. Now consider the deriva-
tive of the term involving ln|A| in (3.86) with respect to α. We have

Since there are M terms in the sum over i, the quantity γ can be written

Exercise 3.20

The interpretation of the quantity γ will be discussed shortly. From (3.90) we see
that the value of α that maximizes the marginal likelihood satisﬁes

α =

γ
N mN
mT

.

(3.92)

Note that this is an implicit solution for α not only because γ depends on α, but also
because the mode mN of the posterior distribution itself depends on the choice of
α. We therefore adopt an iterative procedure in which we make an initial choice for
α and use this to ﬁnd mN , which is given by (3.53), and also to evaluate γ, which
is given by (3.91). These values are then used to re-estimate α using (3.92), and the
process repeated until convergence. Note that because the matrix ΦTΦ is ﬁxed, we
can compute its eigenvalues once at the start and then simply multiply these by β to
obtain the λi.

It should be emphasized that the value of α has been determined purely by look-
ing at the training data. In contrast to maximum likelihood methods, no independent
data set is required in order to optimize the model complexity.

We can similarly maximize the log marginal likelihood (3.86) with respect to β.
To do this, we note that the eigenvalues λi deﬁned by (3.87) are proportional to β,
and hence dλi/dβ = λi/β giving

d

ln|A| = d

Again, this is an implicit solution for β and can be solved by choosing an initial

(3.95), repeating until convergence. If both α and β are to be determined from the
data, then their values can be re-estimated together after each update of γ.

the eigenvalue λ2 is large compared with α and so the

of w2 is close to its maximum likelihood value.

3.5.3 Effective number of parameters
The result (3.92) has an elegant interpretation (MacKay, 1992a), which provides
insight into the Bayesian solution for α. To see this, consider the contours of the like-
lihood function and the prior as illustrated in Figure 3.15. Here we have implicitly
transformed to a rotated set of axes in parameter space aligned with the eigenvec-
tors ui deﬁned in (3.87). Contours of the likelihood function are then axis-aligned
ellipses. The eigenvalues λi measure the curvature of the likelihood function, and
so in Figure 3.15 the eigenvalue λ1 is small compared with λ2 (because a smaller
curvature corresponds to a greater elongation of the contours of the likelihood func-
tion). Because βΦTΦ is a positive deﬁnite matrix, it will have positive eigenvalues,
and so the ratio λi/(λi + α) will lie between 0 and 1. Consequently, the quantity γ
deﬁned by (3.91) will lie in the range 0 (cid:1) γ (cid:1) M. For directions in which λi (cid:12) α,
the corresponding parameter wi will be close to its maximum likelihood value, and
the ratio λi/(λi + α) will be close to 1. Such parameters are called well determined
because their values are tightly constrained by the data. Conversely, for directions
in which λi (cid:13) α, the corresponding parameters wi will be close to zero, as will the
ratios λi/(λi + α). These are directions in which the likelihood function is relatively
insensitive to the parameter value and so the parameter has been set to a small value
by the prior. The quantity γ deﬁned by (3.91) therefore measures the effective total
number of well determined parameters.

We can obtain some insight into the result (3.95) for re-estimating β by com-
paring it with the corresponding maximum likelihood result given by (3.21). Both
of these formulae express the variance (the inverse precision) as an average of the
squared differences between the targets and the model predictions. However, they
differ in that the number of data points N in the denominator of the maximum like-
lihood result is replaced by N − γ in the Bayesian result. We recall from (1.56) that
the maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for a Gaussian distribution over a

single variable x is given by

(3.96)

and that this estimate is biased because the maximum likelihood solution µML for
the mean has ﬁtted some of the noise on the data. In effect, this has used up one
degree of freedom in the model. The corresponding unbiased estimate is given by
(1.59) and takes the form

N(cid:2)

n=1

σ2
MAP =

N − 1

(xn − µML)2.

(3.97)

We shall see in Section 10.1.3 that this result can be obtained from a Bayesian treat-
ment in which we marginalize over the unknown mean. The factor of N − 1 in the
denominator of the Bayesian result takes account of the fact that one degree of free-
dom has been used in ﬁtting the mean and removes the bias of maximum likelihood.
Now consider the corresponding results for the linear regression model. The mean
of the target distribution is now given by the function wTφ(x), which contains M
parameters. However, not all of these parameters are tuned to the data. The effective
number of parameters that are determined by the data is γ, with the remaining M −γ
parameters set to small values by the prior. This is reﬂected in the Bayesian result
for the variance that has a factor N − γ in the denominator, thereby correcting for
the bias of the maximum likelihood result.

We can illustrate the evidence framework for setting hyperparameters using the
sinusoidal synthetic data set from Section 1.1, together with the Gaussian basis func-
tion model comprising 9 basis functions, so that the total number of parameters in
the model is given by M = 10 including the bias. Here, for simplicity of illustra-
tion, we have set β to its true value of 11.1 and then used the evidence framework to
determine α, as shown in Figure 3.16.
We can also see how the parameter α controls the magnitude of the parameters
{wi}, by plotting the individual parameters versus the effective number γ of param-
eters, as shown in Figure 3.17.
If we consider the limit N (cid:12) M in which the number of data points is large in
relation to the number of parameters, then from (3.87) all of the parameters will be
well determined by the data because ΦTΦ involves an implicit sum over data points,
and so the eigenvalues λi increase with the size of the data set. In this case, γ = M,
and the re-estimation equations for α and β become

where EW and ED are deﬁned by (3.25) and (3.26), respectively. These results

3.6. Limitations of Fixed Basis Functions

Throughout this chapter, we have focussed on models comprising a linear combina-
tion of ﬁxed, nonlinear basis functions. We have seen that the assumption of linearity
in the parameters led to a range of useful properties including closed-form solutions
to the least-squares problem, as well as a tractable Bayesian treatment. Furthermore,
for a suitable choice of basis functions, we can model arbitrary nonlinearities in the

Exercises

173

mapping from input variables to targets. In the next chapter, we shall study an anal-
ogous class of models for classiﬁcation.

It might appear, therefore, that such linear models constitute a general purpose
framework for solving problems in pattern recognition. Unfortunately, there are
some signiﬁcant shortcomings with linear models, which will cause us to turn in
later chapters to more complex models such as support vector machines and neural
networks.

The difﬁculty stems from the assumption that the basis functions φj(x) are ﬁxed
before the training data set is observed and is a manifestation of the curse of dimen-
sionality discussed in Section 1.4. As a consequence, the number of basis functions
needs to grow rapidly, often exponentially, with the dimensionality D of the input
space.
Fortunately, there are two properties of real data sets that we can exploit to help
alleviate this problem. First of all, the data vectors {xn} typically lie close to a non-
linear manifold whose intrinsic dimensionality is smaller than that of the input space
as a result of strong correlations between the input variables. We will see an example
of this when we consider images of handwritten digits in Chapter 12. If we are using
localized basis functions, we can arrange that they are scattered in input space only
in regions containing data. This approach is used in radial basis function networks
and also in support vector and relevance vector machines. Neural network models,
which use adaptive basis functions having sigmoidal nonlinearities, can adapt the
parameters so that the regions of input space over which the basis functions vary
corresponds to the data manifold. The second property is that target variables may
have signiﬁcant dependence on only a small number of possible directions within the
data manifold. Neural networks can exploit this property by choosing the directions
in input space to which the basis functions respond.

Linear

Models for

Classiﬁcation

In the previous chapter, we explored a class of regression models having particularly
simple analytical and computational properties. We now discuss an analogous class
of models for solving classiﬁcation problems. The goal in classiﬁcation is to take an
input vector x and to assign it to one of K discrete classes Ck where k = 1, . . . , K.
In the most common scenario, the classes are taken to be disjoint, so that each input is
assigned to one and only one class. The input space is thereby divided into decision
regions whose boundaries are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces. In
this chapter, we consider linear models for classiﬁcation, by which we mean that the
decision surfaces are linear functions of the input vector x and hence are deﬁned
by (D − 1)-dimensional hyperplanes within the D-dimensional input space. Data
sets whose classes can be separated exactly by linear decision surfaces are said to be
linearly separable.

For regression problems, the target variable t was simply the vector of real num-
bers whose values we wish to predict. In the case of classiﬁcation, there are various

179

180

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

ways of using target values to represent class labels. For probabilistic models, the
most convenient, in the case of two-class problems, is the binary representation in
which there is a single target variable t ∈ {0, 1} such that t = 1 represents class C1
and t = 0 represents class C2. We can interpret the value of t as the probability that
the class is C1, with the values of probability taking only the extreme values of 0 and
1. For K > 2 classes, it is convenient to use a 1-of-K coding scheme in which t is
a vector of length K such that if the class is Cj, then all elements tk of t are zero
except element tj, which takes the value 1. For instance, if we have K = 5 classes,
then a pattern from class 2 would be given the target vector

t = (0, 1, 0, 0, 0)T.

Again, we can interpret the value of tk as the probability that the class is Ck. For
nonprobabilistic models, alternative choices of target variable representation will
sometimes prove convenient.

In Chapter 1, we identiﬁed three distinct approaches to the classiﬁcation prob-
lem. The simplest involves constructing a discriminant function that directly assigns
each vector x to a speciﬁc class. A more powerful approach, however, models the
conditional probability distribution p(Ck|x) in an inference stage, and then subse-
quently uses this distribution to make optimal decisions. By separating inference
and decision, we gain numerous beneﬁts, as discussed in Section 1.5.4. There are
two different approaches to determining the conditional probabilities p(Ck|x). One
technique is to model them directly, for example by representing them as parametric
models and then optimizing the parameters using a training set. Alternatively, we
can adopt a generative approach in which we model the class-conditional densities
given by p(x|Ck), together with the prior probabilities p(Ck) for the classes, and then
we compute the required posterior probabilities using Bayes’ theorem

p(Ck|x) = p(x|Ck)p(Ck)

p(x)

.

(4.2)

We shall discuss examples of all three approaches in this chapter.

In the linear regression models considered in Chapter 3, the model prediction
y(x, w) was given by a linear function of the parameters w. In the simplest case,
the model is also linear in the input variables and therefore takes the form y(x) =
wTx + w0, so that y is a real number. For classiﬁcation problems, however, we wish
to predict discrete class labels, or more generally posterior probabilities that lie in
the range (0, 1). To achieve this, we consider a generalization of this model in which
we transform the linear function of w using a nonlinear function f(· ) so that

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

y(x) = f

wTx + w0

(4.3)
In the machine learning literature f(· ) is known as an activation function, whereas
its inverse is called a link function in the statistics literature. The decision surfaces
correspond to y(x) = constant, so that wTx + w0 = constant and hence the deci-
sion surfaces are linear functions of x, even if the function f(·) is nonlinear. For this
reason, the class of models described by (4.3) are called generalized linear models

.

4.1. Discriminant Functions

(McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). Note, however, that in contrast to the models used
for regression, they are no longer linear in the parameters due to the presence of the
nonlinear function f(·). This will lead to more complex analytical and computa-
tional properties than for linear regression models. Nevertheless, these models are
still relatively simple compared to the more general nonlinear models that will be
studied in subsequent chapters.

The algorithms discussed in this chapter will be equally applicable if we ﬁrst
make a ﬁxed nonlinear transformation of the input variables using a vector of basis
functions φ(x) as we did for regression models in Chapter 3. We begin by consider-
ing classiﬁcation directly in the original input space x, while in Section 4.3 we shall
ﬁnd it convenient to switch to a notation involving basis functions for consistency
with later chapters.

4.1. Discriminant Functions

A discriminant is a function that takes an input vector x and assigns it to one of K
classes, denoted Ck. In this chapter, we shall restrict attention to linear discriminants,
namely those for which the decision surfaces are hyperplanes. To simplify the dis-
cussion, we consider ﬁrst the case of two classes and then investigate the extension
to K > 2 classes.

4.1.1 Two classes
The simplest representation of a linear discriminant function is obtained by tak-

ing a linear function of the input vector so that

y(x) = wTx + w0

(4.4)

where w is called a weight vector, and w0 is a bias (not to be confused with bias in
the statistical sense). The negative of the bias is sometimes called a threshold. An
input vector x is assigned to class C1 if y(x) (cid:2) 0 and to class C2 otherwise. The cor-
responding decision boundary is therefore deﬁned by the relation y(x) = 0, which
corresponds to a (D − 1)-dimensional hyperplane within the D-dimensional input
space. Consider two points xA and xB both of which lie on the decision surface.
Because y(xA) = y(xB) = 0, we have wT(xA − xB) = 0 and hence the vector w is
orthogonal to every vector lying within the decision surface, and so w determines the
orientation of the decision surface. Similarly, if x is a point on the decision surface,
then y(x) = 0, and so the normal distance from the origin to the decision surface is
given by

(4.5)

wTx

(cid:5)w(cid:5) = − w0(cid:5)w(cid:5) .

We therefore see that the bias parameter w0 determines the location of the decision
surface. These properties are illustrated for the case of D = 2 in Figure 4.1.

Furthermore, we note that the value of y(x) gives a signed measure of the per-
pendicular distance r of the point x from the decision surface. To see this, consider

182

linear discriminant function in two dimensions.
The decision surface, shown in red, is perpen-
dicular to w, and its displacement from the
origin is controlled by the bias parameter w0.
Also, the signed orthogonal distance of a gen-
eral point x from the decision surface is given
by y(x)/(cid:3)w(cid:3).

an arbitrary point x and let x⊥ be its orthogonal projection onto the decision surface,
so that

x = x⊥ + r

w
(cid:5)w(cid:5) .

(4.6)

(4.8)

Multiplying both sides of this result by wT and adding w0, and making use of y(x) =
wTx + w0 and y(x⊥) = wTx⊥ + w0 = 0, we have

r = y(x)
(cid:5)w(cid:5) .

(4.7)

This result is illustrated in Figure 4.1.

As with the linear regression models in Chapter 3, it is sometimes convenient
to use a more compact notation in which we introduce an additional dummy ‘input’

value x0 = 1 and then deﬁne(cid:4)w = (w0, w) and(cid:4)x = (x0, x) so that

y(x) = (cid:4)wT(cid:4)x.

In this case, the decision surfaces are D-dimensional hyperplanes passing through
the origin of the D + 1-dimensional expanded input space.

4.1.2 Multiple classes
Now consider the extension of linear discriminants to K > 2 classes. We might
be tempted be to build a K-class discriminant by combining a number of two-class
discriminant functions. However, this leads to some serious difﬁculties (Duda and
Hart, 1973) as we now show.
Consider the use of K−1 classiﬁers each of which solves a two-class problem of
separating points in a particular class Ck from points not in that class. This is known
as a one-versus-the-rest classiﬁer. The left-hand example in Figure 4.2 shows an

Figure 4.2 Attempting to construct a K class discriminant from a set of two class discriminants leads to am-
biguous regions, shown in green. On the left is an example involving the use of two discriminants designed to
distinguish points in class Ck from points not in class Ck. On the right is an example involving three discriminant
functions each of which is used to separate a pair of classes Ck and Cj.

example involving three classes where this approach leads to regions of input space
that are ambiguously classiﬁed.
An alternative is to introduce K(K − 1)/2 binary discriminant functions, one
for every possible pair of classes. This is known as a one-versus-one classiﬁer. Each
point is then classiﬁed according to a majority vote amongst the discriminant func-
tions. However, this too runs into the problem of ambiguous regions, as illustrated
in the right-hand diagram of Figure 4.2.

We can avoid these difﬁculties by considering a single K-class discriminant

comprising K linear functions of the form

yk(x) = wT

(4.9)
and then assigning a point x to class Ck if yk(x) > yj(x) for all j (cid:9)= k. The decision
boundary between class Ck and class Cj is therefore given by yk(x) = yj(x) and
hence corresponds to a (D − 1)-dimensional hyperplane deﬁned by

k x + wk0

(wk − wj)Tx + (wk0 − wj0) = 0.

(4.10)

This has the same form as the decision boundary for the two-class case discussed in
Section 4.1.1, and so analogous geometrical properties apply.

The decision regions of such a discriminant are always singly connected and
convex. To see this, consider two points xA and xB both of which lie inside decision

region Rk, as illustrated in Figure 4.3. Any point(cid:1)x that lies on the line connecting

xA and xB can be expressed in the form

(cid:1)x = λxA + (1 − λ)xB

(4.11)

184

and xB both lie inside the same decision re-
gion Rk, then any point bx that lies on the line
connecting these two points must also lie in
Rk, and hence the decision region must be
singly connected and convex.

where 0 (cid:1) λ (cid:1) 1. From the linearity of the discriminant functions, it follows that

yk((cid:1)x) = λyk(xA) + (1 − λ)yk(xB).

yk(xB) > yj(xB), for all j (cid:9)= k, and hence yk((cid:1)x) > yj((cid:1)x), and so(cid:1)x also lies

(4.12)
Because both xA and xB lie inside Rk, it follows that yk(xA) > yj(xA), and
inside Rk. Thus Rk is singly connected and convex.

Note that for two classes, we can either employ the formalism discussed here,
based on two discriminant functions y1(x) and y2(x), or else use the simpler but
equivalent formulation described in Section 4.1.1 based on a single discriminant
function y(x).

We now explore three approaches to learning the parameters of linear discrimi-
nant functions, based on least squares, Fisher’s linear discriminant, and the percep-
tron algorithm.

4.1.3 Least squares for classiﬁcation
In Chapter 3, we considered models that were linear functions of the parame-
ters, and we saw that the minimization of a sum-of-squares error function led to a
simple closed-form solution for the parameter values. It is therefore tempting to see
if we can apply the same formalism to classiﬁcation problems. Consider a general
classiﬁcation problem with K classes, with a 1-of-K binary coding scheme for the
target vector t. One justiﬁcation for using least squares in such a context is that it
approximates the conditional expectation E[t|x] of the target values given the input
vector. For the binary coding scheme, this conditional expectation is given by the
vector of posterior class probabilities. Unfortunately, however, these probabilities
are typically approximated rather poorly, indeed the approximations can have values
outside the range (0, 1), due to the limited ﬂexibility of a linear model as we shall
see shortly.

Each class Ck is described by its own linear model so that

yk(x) = wT

k x + wk0

(4.13)

where k = 1, . . . , K. We can conveniently group these together using vector nota-
tion so that

(4.14)

y(x) =,WT(cid:4)x

can then be written as

a dummy input x0 = 1. This representation was discussed in detail in Section 3.1. A

(4.17)

Exercise 4.2

Section 2.3.7

An interesting property of least-squares solutions with multiple target variables

is that if every target vector in the training set satisﬁes some linear constraint

aTtn + b = 0

(4.18)

for some constants a and b, then the model prediction for any value of x will satisfy
the same constraint so that

aTy(x) + b = 0.

(4.19)
Thus if we use a 1-of-K coding scheme for K classes, then the predictions made
by the model will have the property that the elements of y(x) will sum to 1 for any
value of x. However, this summation constraint alone is not sufﬁcient to allow the
model outputs to be interpreted as probabilities because they are not constrained to
lie within the interval (0, 1).

The least-squares approach gives an exact closed-form solution for the discrimi-
nant function parameters. However, even as a discriminant function (where we use it
to make decisions directly and dispense with any probabilistic interpretation) it suf-
fers from some severe problems. We have already seen that least-squares solutions
lack robustness to outliers, and this applies equally to the classiﬁcation application,
as illustrated in Figure 4.4. Here we see that the additional data points in the right-
hand ﬁgure produce a signiﬁcant change in the location of the decision boundary,
even though these point would be correctly classiﬁed by the original decision bound-
ary in the left-hand ﬁgure. The sum-of-squares error function penalizes predictions
that are ‘too correct’ in that they lie a long way on the correct side of the decision

when extra data points are added at the bottom left of the diagram, showing that least squares is highly sensitive
to outliers, unlike logistic regression.

boundary. In Section 7.1.2, we shall consider several alternative error functions for
classiﬁcation and we shall see that they do not suffer from this difﬁculty.

However, problems with least squares can be more severe than simply lack of
robustness, as illustrated in Figure 4.5. This shows a synthetic data set drawn from
three classes in a two-dimensional input space (x1, x2), having the property that lin-
ear decision boundaries can give excellent separation between the classes. Indeed,
the technique of logistic regression, described later in this chapter, gives a satisfac-
tory solution as seen in the right-hand plot. However, the least-squares solution gives
poor results, with only a small region of the input space assigned to the green class.
The failure of least squares should not surprise us when we recall that it cor-
responds to maximum likelihood under the assumption of a Gaussian conditional
distribution, whereas binary target vectors clearly have a distribution that is far from
Gaussian. By adopting more appropriate probabilistic models, we shall obtain clas-
siﬁcation techniques with much better properties than least squares. For the moment,
however, we continue to explore alternative nonprobabilistic methods for setting the
parameters in the linear classiﬁcation models.

4.1.4 Fisher’s linear discriminant
One way to view a linear classiﬁcation model is in terms of dimensionality
reduction. Consider ﬁrst the case of two classes, and suppose we take the D-

(×), green (+), and blue (◦). Lines denote the decision boundaries, and the background colours denote the
respective classes of the decision regions. On the left is the result of using a least-squares discriminant. We see
that the region of input space assigned to the green class is too small and so most of the points from this class

correct classiﬁcation of the training data.

dimensional input vector x and project it down to one dimension using

y = wTx.

(4.20)
If we place a threshold on y and classify y (cid:2) −w0 as class C1, and otherwise class
C2, then we obtain our standard linear classiﬁer discussed in the previous section.
In general, the projection onto one dimension leads to a considerable loss of infor-
mation, and classes that are well separated in the original D-dimensional space may
become strongly overlapping in one dimension. However, by adjusting the com-
ponents of the weight vector w, we can select a projection that maximizes the class
separation. To begin with, consider a two-class problem in which there are N1 points
of class C1 and N2 points of class C2, so that the mean vectors of the two classes are
given by

The simplest measure of the separation of the classes, when projected onto w, is the
separation of the projected class means. This suggests that we might choose w so as
to maximize

m2 − m1 = wT(m2 − m1)

where

mk = wTmk

problem, we could constrain w to have unit length, so that
a Lagrange multiplier to perform the constrained maximization, we then ﬁnd that
w ∝ (m2 − m1). There is still a problem with this approach, however, as illustrated
in Figure 4.6. This shows two classes that are well separated in the original two-
dimensional space (x1, x2) but that have considerable overlap when projected onto
the line joining their means. This difﬁculty arises from the strongly nondiagonal
covariances of the class distributions. The idea proposed by Fisher is to maximize
a function that will give a large separation between the projected class means while
also giving a small variance within each class, thereby minimizing the class overlap.
The projection formula (4.20) transforms the set of labelled data points in x
into a labelled set in the one-dimensional space y. The within-class variance of the
transformed data from class Ck is therefore given by

where yn = wTxn. We can deﬁne the total within-class variance for the whole

(4.25)

We can make the dependence on w explicit by using (4.20), (4.23), and (4.24) to
rewrite the Fisher criterion in the form

J(w) =

where SB is the between-class covariance matrix and is given by

SB = (m2 − m1)(m2 − m1)T
and SW is the total within-class covariance matrix, given by

Differentiating (4.26) with respect to w, we ﬁnd that J(w) is maximized when

(wTSBw)SWw = (wTSWw)SBw.

(4.29)
From (4.27), we see that SBw is always in the direction of (m2−m1). Furthermore,
we do not care about the magnitude of w, only its direction, and so we can drop the
−1
scalar factors (wTSBw) and (wTSWw). Multiplying both sides of (4.29) by S
W
we then obtain

(4.30)
Note that if the within-class covariance is isotropic, so that SW is proportional to the
unit matrix, we ﬁnd that w is proportional to the difference of the class means, as
discussed above.

w ∝ S

W (m2 − m1).

The result (4.30) is known as Fisher’s linear discriminant, although strictly it
is not a discriminant but rather a speciﬁc choice of direction for projection of the
data down to one dimension. However, the projected data can subsequently be used
to construct a discriminant, by choosing a threshold y0 so that we classify a new
point as belonging to C1 if y(x) (cid:2) y0 and classify it as belonging to C2 otherwise.
For example, we can model the class-conditional densities p(y|Ck) using Gaussian
distributions and then use the techniques of Section 1.2.4 to ﬁnd the parameters
of the Gaussian distributions by maximum likelihood. Having found Gaussian ap-
proximations to the projected classes, the formalism of Section 1.5.1 then gives an
expression for the optimal threshold. Some justiﬁcation for the Gaussian assumption
comes from the central limit theorem by noting that y = wTx is the sum of a set of
random variables.

4.1.5 Relation to least squares
The least-squares approach to the determination of a linear discriminant was
based on the goal of making the model predictions as close as possible to a set of
target values. By contrast, the Fisher criterion was derived by requiring maximum
class separation in the output space. It is interesting to see the relationship between
these two approaches. In particular, we shall show that, for the two-class problem,
the Fisher criterion can be obtained as a special case of least squares.

So far we have considered 1-of-K coding for the target values. If, however, we
adopt a slightly different target coding scheme, then the least-squares solution for

190

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

the weights becomes equivalent to the Fisher solution (Duda and Hart, 1973). In
particular, we shall take the targets for class C1 to be N/N1, where N1 is the number
of patterns in class C1, and N is the total number of patterns. This target value
approximates the reciprocal of the prior probability for class C1. For class C2, we
shall take the targets to be −N/N2, where N2 is the number of patterns in class C2.

Setting the derivatives of E with respect to w0 and w to zero, we obtain respectively

w ∝ S

(4.38)

where we have ignored irrelevant scale factors. Thus the weight vector coincides
with that found from the Fisher criterion. In addition, we have also found an expres-
sion for the bias value w0 given by (4.34). This tells us that a new vector x should be
classiﬁed as belonging to class C1 if y(x) = wT(x−m) > 0 and class C2 otherwise.

Again we wish to construct a scalar that is large when the between-class covariance
is large and when the within-class covariance is small. There are now many possible
choices of criterion (Fukunaga, 1990). One example is given by

(cid:27)

This criterion can then be rewritten as an explicit function of the projection matrix
W in the form

J(w) = Tr

(WSWWT)−1(WSBWT)

.

(4.51)

(cid:4)

Maximization of such criteria is straightforward, though somewhat involved, and is
discussed at length in Fukunaga (1990). The weight values are determined by those
eigenvectors of S

−1
W SB that correspond to the D

largest eigenvalues.

There is one important result that is common to all such criteria, which is worth
emphasizing. We ﬁrst note from (4.46) that SB is composed of the sum of K ma-
trices, each of which is an outer product of two vectors and therefore of rank 1. In
addition, only (K − 1) of these matrices are independent as a result of the constraint
(4.44). Thus, SB has rank at most equal to (K − 1) and so there are at most (K − 1)
nonzero eigenvalues. This shows that the projection onto the (K − 1)-dimensional
subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of SB does not alter the value of J(w), and
so we are therefore unable to ﬁnd more than (K − 1) linear ‘features’ by this means
(Fukunaga, 1990).

4.1.7 The perceptron algorithm
Another example of a linear discriminant model is the perceptron of Rosenblatt
(1962), which occupies an important place in the history of pattern recognition al-
gorithms. It corresponds to a two-class model in which the input vector x is ﬁrst
transformed using a ﬁxed nonlinear transformation to give a feature vector φ(x),
and this is then used to construct a generalized linear model of the form

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

y(x) = f

wTφ(x)

(4.52)

4.1. Discriminant Functions

193

where the nonlinear activation function f(·) is given by a step function of the form

f(a) =

+1, a (cid:2) 0
−1, a < 0.

(4.53)

(cid:12)

The vector φ(x) will typically include a bias component φ0(x) = 1.
In earlier
discussions of two-class classiﬁcation problems, we have focussed on a target coding
scheme in which t ∈ {0, 1}, which is appropriate in the context of probabilistic
models. For the perceptron, however, it is more convenient to use target values
t = +1 for class C1 and t = −1 for class C2, which matches the choice of activation
function.

The algorithm used to determine the parameters w of the perceptron can most
easily be motivated by error function minimization. A natural choice of error func-
tion would be the total number of misclassiﬁed patterns. However, this does not lead
to a simple learning algorithm because the error is a piecewise constant function
of w, with discontinuities wherever a change in w causes the decision boundary to
move across one of the data points. Methods based on changing w using the gradi-
ent of the error function cannot then be applied, because the gradient is zero almost
everywhere.

We therefore consider an alternative error function known as the perceptron cri-
terion. To derive this, we note that we are seeking a weight vector w such that
patterns xn in class C1 will have wTφ(xn) > 0, whereas patterns xn in class C2
have wTφ(xn) < 0. Using the t ∈ {−1, +1} target coding scheme it follows that
we would like all patterns to satisfy wTφ(xn)tn > 0. The perceptron criterion
associates zero error with any pattern that is correctly classiﬁed, whereas for a mis-
classiﬁed pattern xn it tries to minimize the quantity −wTφ(xn)tn. The perceptron
criterion is therefore given by

EP(w) = −

wTφntn

Frank Rosenblatt
1928–1969

Rosenblatt’s perceptron played an
important role in the history of ma-
chine learning.
Initially, Rosenblatt
simulated the perceptron on an IBM
704 computer at Cornell
in 1957,
but by the early 1960s he had built
special-purpose hardware that provided a direct, par-
allel implementation of perceptron learning. Many of
his ideas were encapsulated in “Principles of Neuro-
dynamics: Perceptrons and the Theory of Brain Mech-
anisms” published in 1962. Rosenblatt’s work was
criticized by Marvin Minksy, whose objections were
published in the book “Perceptrons”, co-authored with

Seymour Papert. This book was widely misinter-
preted at the time as showing that neural networks
were fatally ﬂawed and could only learn solutions for
linearly separable problems.
In fact, it only proved
such limitations in the case of single-layer networks
such as the perceptron and merely conjectured (in-
correctly) that they applied to more general network
models. Unfortunately, however, this book contributed
to the substantial decline in research funding for neu-
ral computing, a situation that was not reversed un-
til the mid-1980s. Today, there are many hundreds,
if not thousands, of applications of neural networks
in widespread use, with examples in areas such as
handwriting recognition and information retrieval be-
ing used routinely by millions of people.

194

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

Section 3.1.3

where M denotes the set of all misclassiﬁed patterns. The contribution to the error
associated with a particular misclassiﬁed pattern is a linear function of w in regions
of w space where the pattern is misclassiﬁed and zero in regions where it is correctly
classiﬁed. The total error function is therefore piecewise linear.

We now apply the stochastic gradient descent algorithm to this error function.

The change in the weight vector w is then given by

w(τ +1) = w(τ ) − η∇EP(w) = w(τ ) + ηφntn

(4.55)

where η is the learning rate parameter and τ is an integer that indexes the steps of
the algorithm. Because the perceptron function y(x, w) is unchanged if we multiply
w by a constant, we can set the learning rate parameter η equal to 1 without of
generality. Note that, as the weight vector evolves during training, the set of patterns
that are misclassiﬁed will change.

The perceptron learning algorithm has a simple interpretation, as follows. We
cycle through the training patterns in turn, and for each pattern xn we evaluate the
perceptron function (4.52).
If the pattern is correctly classiﬁed, then the weight
vector remains unchanged, whereas if it is incorrectly classiﬁed, then for class C1
we add the vector φ(xn) onto the current estimate of weight vector w while for
class C2 we subtract the vector φ(xn) from w. The perceptron learning algorithm is
illustrated in Figure 4.7.

If we consider the effect of a single update in the perceptron learning algorithm,
we see that the contribution to the error from a misclassiﬁed pattern will be reduced
because from (4.55) we have

−w(τ +1)Tφntn = −w(τ )Tφntn − (φntn)Tφntn < −w(τ )Tφntn

(4.56)
where we have set η = 1, and made use of (cid:5)φntn(cid:5)2 > 0. Of course, this does
not imply that the contribution to the error function from the other misclassiﬁed
patterns will have been reduced. Furthermore, the change in weight vector may have
caused some previously correctly classiﬁed patterns to become misclassiﬁed. Thus
the perceptron learning rule is not guaranteed to reduce the total error function at
each stage.

However, the perceptron convergence theorem states that if there exists an ex-
act solution (in other words, if the training data set is linearly separable), then the
perceptron learning algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd an exact solution in a ﬁnite num-
ber of steps. Proofs of this theorem can be found for example in Rosenblatt (1962),
Block (1962), Nilsson (1965), Minsky and Papert (1969), Hertz et al. (1991), and
Bishop (1995a). Note, however, that the number of steps required to achieve con-
vergence could still be substantial, and in practice, until convergence is achieved,
we will not be able to distinguish between a nonseparable problem and one that is
simply slow to converge.

Even when the data set is linearly separable, there may be many solutions, and
which one is found will depend on the initialization of the parameters and on the or-
der of presentation of the data points. Furthermore, for data sets that are not linearly
separable, the perceptron learning algorithm will never converge.

classes (red and blue) in a two-dimensional feature space (φ1, φ2). The top left plot shows the initial parameter
vector w shown as a black arrow together with the corresponding decision boundary (black line), in which the
arrow points towards the decision region which classiﬁed as belonging to the red class. The data point circled
in green is misclassiﬁed and so its feature vector is added to the current weight vector, giving the new decision
boundary shown in the top right plot. The bottom left plot shows the next misclassiﬁed point to be considered,
indicated by the green circle, and its feature vector is again added to the weight vector giving the decision

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

Figure 4.8 Illustration of the Mark 1 perceptron hardware. The photograph on the left shows how the inputs
were obtained using a simple camera system in which an input scene, in this case a printed character, was
illuminated by powerful lights, and an image focussed onto a 20 × 20 array of cadmium sulphide photocells,
giving a primitive 400 pixel image. The perceptron also had a patch board, shown in the middle photograph,
which allowed different conﬁgurations of input features to be tried. Often these were wired up at random to
demonstrate the ability of the perceptron to learn without the need for precise wiring, in contrast to a modern
digital computer. The photograph on the right shows one of the racks of adaptive weights. Each weight was
implemented using a rotary variable resistor, also called a potentiometer, driven by an electric motor thereby
allowing the value of the weight to be adjusted automatically by the learning algorithm.

Aside from difﬁculties with the learning algorithm, the perceptron does not pro-
vide probabilistic outputs, nor does it generalize readily to K > 2 classes. The most
important limitation, however, arises from the fact that (in common with all of the
models discussed in this chapter and the previous one) it is based on linear com-
binations of ﬁxed basis functions. More detailed discussions of the limitations of
perceptrons can be found in Minsky and Papert (1969) and Bishop (1995a).

Analogue hardware implementations of the perceptron were built by Rosenblatt,
based on motor-driven variable resistors to implement the adaptive parameters wj.
These are illustrated in Figure 4.8. The inputs were obtained from a simple camera
system based on an array of photo-sensors, while the basis functions φ could be
chosen in a variety of ways, for example based on simple ﬁxed functions of randomly
chosen subsets of pixels from the input image. Typical applications involved learning
to discriminate simple shapes or characters.

At the same time that the perceptron was being developed, a closely related
system called the adaline, which is short for ‘adaptive linear element’, was being
explored by Widrow and co-workers. The functional form of the model was the same
as for the perceptron, but a different approach to training was adopted (Widrow and
Hoff, 1960; Widrow and Lehr, 1990).

4.2. Probabilistic Generative Models

We turn next to a probabilistic view of classiﬁcation and show how models with
linear decision boundaries arise from simple assumptions about the distribution of
the data. In Section 1.5.4, we discussed the distinction between the discriminative
and the generative approaches to classiﬁcation. Here we shall adopt a generative

approach in which we model the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck), as well as the
class priors p(Ck), and then use these to compute posterior probabilities p(Ck|x)

which is plotted in Figure 4.9. The term ‘sigmoid’ means S-shaped. This type of
function is sometimes also called a ‘squashing function’ because it maps the whole
real axis into a ﬁnite interval. The logistic sigmoid has been encountered already
in earlier chapters and plays an important role in many classiﬁcation algorithms. It
satisﬁes the following symmetry property

as is easily veriﬁed. The inverse of the logistic sigmoid is given by

σ(−a) = 1 − σ(a)

and is known as the logit function. It represents the log of the ratio of probabilities
ln [p(C1|x)/p(C2|x)] for the two classes, also known as the log odds.

198

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

Note that in (4.57) we have simply rewritten the posterior probabilities in an
equivalent form, and so the appearance of the logistic sigmoid may seem rather vac-
uous. However, it will have signiﬁcance provided a(x) takes a simple functional
form. We shall shortly consider situations in which a(x) is a linear function of x, in
which case the posterior probability is governed by a generalized linear model.

For the case of K > 2 classes, we have

p(Ck|x) =

=

(cid:5)
p(x|Ck)p(Ck)
j p(x|Cj)p(Cj)
(cid:5)
exp(ak)
j exp(aj)

(4.62)

which is known as the normalized exponential and can be regarded as a multiclass
generalization of the logistic sigmoid. Here the quantities ak are deﬁned by

ak = ln p(x|Ck)p(Ck).

(4.63)

The normalized exponential is also known as the softmax function, as it represents
a smoothed version of the ‘max’ function because, if ak (cid:12) aj for all j (cid:9)= k, then
p(Ck|x) (cid:7) 1, and p(Cj|x) (cid:7) 0.

We now investigate the consequences of choosing speciﬁc forms for the class-
conditional densities, looking ﬁrst at continuous input variables x and then dis-
cussing brieﬂy the case of discrete inputs.

4.2.1 Continuous inputs
Let us assume that the class-conditional densities are Gaussian and then explore
the resulting form for the posterior probabilities. To start with, we shall assume that
all classes share the same covariance matrix. Thus the density for class Ck is given
by

We see that the quadratic terms in x from the exponents of the Gaussian densities
have cancelled (due to the assumption of common covariance matrices) leading to
a linear function of x in the argument of the logistic sigmoid. This result is illus-
trated for the case of a two-dimensional input space x in Figure 4.10. The resulting

Figure 4.10 The left-hand plot shows the class-conditional densities for two classes, denoted red and blue.
On the right is the corresponding posterior probability p(C1|x), which is given by a logistic sigmoid of a linear
function of x. The surface in the right-hand plot is coloured using a proportion of red ink given by p(C1|x) and a
proportion of blue ink given by p(C2|x) = 1 − p(C1|x).

decision boundaries correspond to surfaces along which the posterior probabilities
p(Ck|x) are constant and so will be given by linear functions of x, and therefore
the decision boundaries are linear in input space. The prior probabilities p(Ck) enter
only through the bias parameter w0 so that changes in the priors have the effect of
making parallel shifts of the decision boundary and more generally of the parallel
contours of constant posterior probability.

For the general case of K classes we have, from (4.62) and (4.63),

ak(x) = wT

(4.68)

(4.69)

(4.70)

We see that the ak(x) are again linear functions of x as a consequence of the cancel-
lation of the quadratic terms due to the shared covariances. The resulting decision
boundaries, corresponding to the minimum misclassiﬁcation rate, will occur when
two of the posterior probabilities (the two largest) are equal, and so will be deﬁned
by linear functions of x, and so again we have a generalized linear model.
If we relax the assumption of a shared covariance matrix and allow each class-
conditional density p(x|Ck) to have its own covariance matrix Σk, then the earlier
cancellations will no longer occur, and we will obtain quadratic functions of x, giv-
ing rise to a quadratic discriminant. The linear and quadratic decision boundaries
are illustrated in Figure 4.11.

Figure 4.11 The left-hand plot shows the class-conditional densities for three classes each having a Gaussian
distribution, coloured red, green, and blue, in which the red and green classes have the same covariance matrix.
The right-hand plot shows the corresponding posterior probabilities, in which the RGB colour vector represents
the posterior probabilities for the respective three classes. The decision boundaries are also shown. Notice that
the boundary between the red and green classes, which have the same covariance matrix, is linear, whereas
those between the other pairs of classes are quadratic.

4.2.2 Maximum likelihood solution
Once we have speciﬁed a parametric functional form for the class-conditional
densities p(x|Ck), we can then determine the values of the parameters, together with
the prior class probabilities p(Ck), using maximum likelihood. This requires a data
set comprising observations of x along with their corresponding class labels.
Consider ﬁrst the case of two classes, each having a Gaussian class-conditional
density with a shared covariance matrix, and suppose we have a data set {xn, tn}
where n = 1, . . . , N. Here tn = 1 denotes class C1 and tn = 0 denotes class C2. We
denote the prior class probability p(C1) = π, so that p(C2) = 1 − π. For a data point
xn from class C1, we have tn = 1 and hence

p(xn,C1) = p(C1)p(xn|C1) = πN (xn|µ1, Σ).

Similarly for class C2, we have tn = 0 and hence

p(xn,C2) = p(C2)p(xn|C2) = (1 − π)N (xn|µ2, Σ).

Thus the likelihood function is given by

N(cid:14)

p(t|π, µ1, µ2, Σ) =

[πN (xn|µ1, Σ)]tn [(1 − π)N (xn|µ2, Σ)]1−tn

(4.71)

n=1

where t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. As usual, it is convenient to maximize the log of the
likelihood function. Consider ﬁrst the maximization with respect to π. The terms in

Exercise 4.9

the log likelihood function that depend on π are

{tn ln π + (1 − tn) ln(1 − π)} .

(4.73)
where N1 denotes the total number of data points in class C1, and N2 denotes the total
number of data points in class C2. Thus the maximum likelihood estimate for π is
simply the fraction of points in class C1 as expected. This result is easily generalized
to the multiclass case where again the maximum likelihood estimate of the prior
probability associated with class Ck is given by the fraction of the training set points
assigned to that class.
N(cid:2)

Now consider the maximization with respect to µ1. Again we can pick out of

the log likelihood function those terms that depend on µ1 giving

Setting the derivative with respect to µ1 to zero and rearranging, we obtain

have

Using the standard result for the maximum likelihood solution for a Gaussian distri-
bution, we see that Σ = S, which represents a weighted average of the covariance
matrices associated with each of the two classes separately.

This result is easily extended to the K class problem to obtain the corresponding
maximum likelihood solutions for the parameters in which each class-conditional
density is Gaussian with a shared covariance matrix. Note that the approach of ﬁtting
Gaussian distributions to the classes is not robust to outliers, because the maximum
likelihood estimation of a Gaussian is not robust.

4.2.3 Discrete features
Let us now consider the case of discrete feature values xi. For simplicity, we
begin by looking at binary feature values xi ∈ {0, 1} and discuss the extension to
more general discrete features shortly. If there are D inputs, then a general distribu-
tion would correspond to a table of 2D numbers for each class, containing 2D − 1
independent variables (due to the summation constraint). Because this grows expo-
nentially with the number of features, we might seek a more restricted representa-
tion. Here we will make the naive Bayes assumption in which the feature values are
treated as independent, conditioned on the class Ck. Thus we have class-conditional
distributions of the form

p(x|Ck) =

ki(1 − µki)1−xi
µxi

(4.81)

D(cid:14)

which contain D independent parameters for each class. Substituting into (4.63) then
gives

(4.82)

D(cid:2)

which again are linear functions of the input values xi. For the case of K = 2 classes,
we can alternatively consider the logistic sigmoid formulation given by (4.57). Anal-
ogous results are obtained for discrete variables each of which can take M > 2
states.

4.2.4 Exponential family
As we have seen, for both Gaussian distributed and discrete inputs, the posterior
class probabilities are given by generalized linear models with logistic sigmoid (K =

4.3. Probabilistic Discriminative Models

203

2 classes) or softmax (K (cid:2) 2 classes) activation functions. These are particular cases
of a more general result obtained by assuming that the class-conditional densities
p(x|Ck) are members of the exponential family of distributions.
(cid:27)

Using the form (2.194) for members of the exponential family, we see that the

distribution of x can be written in the form

(cid:26)

p(x|λk) = h(x)g(λk) exp

λT

k u(x)

.

(4.83)

We now restrict attention to the subclass of such distributions for which u(x) = x.
Then we make use of (2.236) to introduce a scaling parameter s, so that we obtain
the restricted set of exponential family class-conditional densities of the form

(cid:15)

p(x|λk, s) =

(4.84)

Note that we are allowing each class to have its own parameter vector λk but we are
assuming that the classes share the same scale parameter s.

For the two-class problem, we substitute this expression for the class-conditional
densities into (4.58) and we see that the posterior class probability is again given by
a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function a(x) which is given by

a(x) = (λ1 − λ2)Tx + ln g(λ1) − ln g(λ2) + ln p(C1) − ln p(C2).

(4.85)

Similarly, for the K-class problem, we substitute the class-conditional density ex-
pression into (4.63) to give

ak(x) = λT

k x + ln g(λk) + ln p(Ck)

(4.86)

and so again is a linear function of x.

4.3. Probabilistic Discriminative Models

For the two-class classiﬁcation problem, we have seen that the posterior probability
of class C1 can be written as a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function of x, for a
wide choice of class-conditional distributions p(x|Ck). Similarly, for the multiclass
case, the posterior probability of class Ck is given by a softmax transformation of a
linear function of x. For speciﬁc choices of the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck),
we have used maximum likelihood to determine the parameters of the densities as
well as the class priors p(Ck) and then used Bayes’ theorem to ﬁnd the posterior class
probabilities.

However, an alternative approach is to use the functional form of the generalized
linear model explicitly and to determine its parameters directly by using maximum
likelihood. We shall see that there is an efﬁcient algorithm ﬁnding such solutions
known as iterative reweighted least squares, or IRLS.

The indirect approach to ﬁnding the parameters of a generalized linear model,
by ﬁtting class-conditional densities and class priors separately and then applying

Figure 4.12 Illustration of the role of nonlinear basis functions in linear classiﬁcation models. The left plot
shows the original input space (x1, x2) together with data points from two classes labelled red and blue. Two
‘Gaussian’ basis functions φ1(x) and φ2(x) are deﬁned in this space with centres shown by the green crosses
and with contours shown by the green circles. The right-hand plot shows the corresponding feature space
(φ1, φ2) together with the linear decision boundary obtained given by a logistic regression model of the form
discussed in Section 4.3.2. This corresponds to a nonlinear decision boundary in the original input space,
shown by the black curve in the left-hand plot.

Bayes’ theorem, represents an example of generative modelling, because we could
take such a model and generate synthetic data by drawing values of x from the
marginal distribution p(x). In the direct approach, we are maximizing a likelihood
function deﬁned through the conditional distribution p(Ck|x), which represents a
form of discriminative training. One advantage of the discriminative approach is
that there will typically be fewer adaptive parameters to be determined, as we shall
see shortly. It may also lead to improved predictive performance, particularly when
the class-conditional density assumptions give a poor approximation to the true dis-
tributions.

4.3.1 Fixed basis functions
So far in this chapter, we have considered classiﬁcation models that work di-
rectly with the original input vector x. However, all of the algorithms are equally
applicable if we ﬁrst make a ﬁxed nonlinear transformation of the inputs using a
vector of basis functions φ(x). The resulting decision boundaries will be linear in
the feature space φ, and these correspond to nonlinear decision boundaries in the
original x space, as illustrated in Figure 4.12. Classes that are linearly separable
in the feature space φ(x) need not be linearly separable in the original observation
space x. Note that as in our discussion of linear models for regression, one of the

4.3. Probabilistic Discriminative Models

205

basis functions is typically set to a constant, say φ0(x) = 1, so that the correspond-
ing parameter w0 plays the role of a bias. For the remainder of this chapter, we shall
include a ﬁxed basis function transformation φ(x), as this will highlight some useful
similarities to the regression models discussed in Chapter 3.
For many problems of practical interest, there is signiﬁcant overlap between
the class-conditional densities p(x|Ck). This corresponds to posterior probabilities
p(Ck|x), which, for at least some values of x, are not 0 or 1. In such cases, the opti-
mal solution is obtained by modelling the posterior probabilities accurately and then
applying standard decision theory, as discussed in Chapter 1. Note that nonlinear
transformations φ(x) cannot remove such class overlap. Indeed, they can increase
the level of overlap, or create overlap where none existed in the original observation
space. However, suitable choices of nonlinearity can make the process of modelling
the posterior probabilities easier.

Such ﬁxed basis function models have important limitations, and these will be
resolved in later chapters by allowing the basis functions themselves to adapt to the
data. Notwithstanding these limitations, models with ﬁxed nonlinear basis functions
play an important role in applications, and a discussion of such models will intro-
duce many of the key concepts needed for an understanding of their more complex
counterparts.

4.3.2 Logistic regression
We begin our treatment of generalized linear models by considering the problem
of two-class classiﬁcation. In our discussion of generative approaches in Section 4.2,
we saw that under rather general assumptions, the posterior probability of class C1
can be written as a logistic sigmoid acting on a linear function of the feature vector
φ so that
(4.87)
with p(C2|φ) = 1 − p(C1|φ). Here σ(·) is the logistic sigmoid function deﬁned by
(4.59). In the terminology of statistics, this model is known as logistic regression,
although it should be emphasized that this is a model for classiﬁcation rather than
regression.

p(C1|φ) = y(φ) = σ

wTφ

For an M-dimensional feature space φ, this model has M adjustable parameters.
By contrast, if we had ﬁtted Gaussian class conditional densities using maximum
likelihood, we would have used 2M parameters for the means and M(M + 1)/2
parameters for the (shared) covariance matrix. Together with the class prior p(C1),
this gives a total of M(M +5)/2+1 parameters, which grows quadratically with M,
in contrast to the linear dependence on M of the number of parameters in logistic
regression. For large values of M, there is a clear advantage in working with the
logistic regression model directly.

We now use maximum likelihood to determine the parameters of the logistic
regression model. To do this, we shall make use of the derivative of the logistic sig-
moid function, which can conveniently be expressed in terms of the sigmoid function
itself

(4.89)

where t = (t1, . . . , tN )T and yn = p(C1|φn). As usual, we can deﬁne an error
function by taking the negative logarithm of the likelihood, which gives the cross-
entropy error function in the form

respect to w, we obtain

∇E(w) =

(yn − tn)φn

(4.91)

n=1

where we have made use of (4.88). We see that the factor involving the derivative
of the logistic sigmoid has cancelled, leading to a simpliﬁed form for the gradient
of the log likelihood. In particular, the contribution to the gradient from data point
n is given by the ‘error’ yn − tn between the target value and the prediction of the
model, times the basis function vector φn. Furthermore, comparison with (3.13)
shows that this takes precisely the same form as the gradient of the sum-of-squares
error function for the linear regression model.

If desired, we could make use of the result (4.91) to give a sequential algorithm
in which patterns are presented one at a time, in which each of the weight vectors is
updated using (3.22) in which ∇En is the nth term in (4.91).

It is worth noting that maximum likelihood can exhibit severe over-ﬁtting for
data sets that are linearly separable. This arises because the maximum likelihood so-
lution occurs when the hyperplane corresponding to σ = 0.5, equivalent to wTφ =
0, separates the two classes and the magnitude of w goes to inﬁnity. In this case, the
logistic sigmoid function becomes inﬁnitely steep in feature space, corresponding to
a Heaviside step function, so that every training point from each class k is assigned
a posterior probability p(Ck|x) = 1. Furthermore, there is typically a continuum
of such solutions because any separating hyperplane will give rise to the same pos-
terior probabilities at the training data points, as will be seen later in Figure 10.13.
Maximum likelihood provides no way to favour one such solution over another, and
which solution is found in practice will depend on the choice of optimization algo-
rithm and on the parameter initialization. Note that the problem will arise even if
the number of data points is large compared with the number of parameters in the
model, so long as the training data set is linearly separable. The singularity can be
avoided by inclusion of a prior and ﬁnding a MAP solution for w, or equivalently by
adding a regularization term to the error function.

4.3.3 Iterative reweighted least squares
In the case of the linear regression models discussed in Chapter 3, the maxi-
mum likelihood solution, on the assumption of a Gaussian noise model, leads to a
closed-form solution. This was a consequence of the quadratic dependence of the
log likelihood function on the parameter vector w. For logistic regression, there
is no longer a closed-form solution, due to the nonlinearity of the logistic sigmoid
function. However, the departure from a quadratic form is not substantial. To be
precise, the error function is concave, as we shall see shortly, and hence has a unique
minimum. Furthermore, the error function can be minimized by an efﬁcient iterative
technique based on the Newton-Raphson iterative optimization scheme, which uses a
local quadratic approximation to the log likelihood function. The Newton-Raphson
update, for minimizing a function E(w), takes the form (Fletcher, 1987; Bishop and
Nabney, 2008)

(4.92)
where H is the Hessian matrix whose elements comprise the second derivatives of
E(w) with respect to the components of w.

Let us ﬁrst of all apply the Newton-Raphson method to the linear regression
model (3.3) with the sum-of-squares error function (3.12). The gradient and Hessian
of this error function are given by

w(new) = w(old) − H−1∇E(w).

Now let us apply the Newton-Raphson update to the cross-entropy error function
(4.90) for the logistic regression model. From (4.91) we see that the gradient and

where we have made use of (4.88). Also, we have introduced the N × N diagonal
matrix R with elements

(4.98)
We see that the Hessian is no longer constant but depends on w through the weight-
ing matrix R, corresponding to the fact that the error function is no longer quadratic.
Using the property 0 < yn < 1, which follows from the form of the logistic sigmoid
function, we see that uTHu > 0 for an arbitrary vector u, and so the Hessian matrix
H is positive deﬁnite. It follows that the error function is a concave function of w
and hence has a unique minimum.

comes

where z is an N-dimensional vector with elements

z = Φw(old) − R−1(y − t).

(4.99)

(4.100)

We see that the update formula (4.99) takes the form of a set of normal equations for a
weighted least-squares problem. Because the weighing matrix R is not constant but
depends on the parameter vector w, we must apply the normal equations iteratively,
each time using the new weight vector w to compute a revised weighing matrix
R. For this reason, the algorithm is known as iterative reweighted least squares, or
IRLS (Rubin, 1983). As in the weighted least-squares problem, the elements of the
diagonal weighting matrix R can be interpreted as variances because the mean and
variance of t in the logistic regression model are given by

E[t] = σ(x) = y
var[t] = E[t2] − E[t]2 = σ(x) − σ(x)2 = y(1 − y)

(4.101)
(4.102)
where we have used the property t2 = t for t ∈ {0, 1}. In fact, we can interpret IRLS
as the solution to a linearized problem in the space of the variable a = wTφ. The
quantity zn, which corresponds to the nth element of z, can then be given a simple
interpretation as an effective target value in this space obtained by making a local
linear approximation to the logistic sigmoid function around the current operating
point w(old)

4.3.4 Multiclass logistic regression
In our discussion of generative models for multiclass classiﬁcation, we have
seen that for a large class of distributions, the posterior probabilities are given by a
softmax transformation of linear functions of the feature variables, so that

p(Ck|φ) = yk(φ) =

(cid:5)

exp(ak)
j exp(aj)

(4.104)

(4.105)

where the ‘activations’ ak are given by

ak = wT

k φ.

There we used maximum likelihood to determine separately the class-conditional
densities and the class priors and then found the corresponding posterior probabilities
using Bayes’ theorem, thereby implicitly determining the parameters {wk}. Here we
consider the use of maximum likelihood to determine the parameters {wk} of this
model directly. To do this, we will require the derivatives of yk with respect to all of
the activations aj. These are given by

Exercise 4.17

= yk(Ikj − yj)

∂yk
∂aj

(4.106)

where Ikj are the elements of the identity matrix.

Next we write down the likelihood function. This is most easily done using
the 1-of-K coding scheme in which the target vector tn for a feature vector φn
belonging to class Ck is a binary vector with all elements zero except for element k,
which equals one. The likelihood function is then given by

N(cid:14)

where ynk = yk(φn), and T is an N × K matrix of target variables with elements

(cid:5)

k tnk = 1. Once again, we see the same form arising
where we have made use of
for the gradient as was found for the sum-of-squares error function with the linear
model and the cross-entropy error for the logistic regression model, namely the prod-
uct of the error (ynj − tnj) times the basis function φn. Again, we could use this
to formulate a sequential algorithm in which patterns are presented one at a time, in
which each of the weight vectors is updated using (3.22).

We have seen that the derivative of the log likelihood function for a linear regres-
sion model with respect to the parameter vector w for a data point n took the form
of the ‘error’ yn − tn times the feature vector φn. Similarly, for the combination
of logistic sigmoid activation function and cross-entropy error function (4.90), and
for the softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function
(4.108), we again obtain this same simple form. This is an example of a more general
result, as we shall see in Section 4.3.6.

To ﬁnd a batch algorithm, we again appeal to the Newton-Raphson update to
obtain the corresponding IRLS algorithm for the multiclass problem. This requires
evaluation of the Hessian matrix that comprises blocks of size M × M in which
block j, k is given by

∇wj E(w1, . . . , wK) = − N(cid:2)

(4.110)

Exercise 4.20

As with the two-class problem, the Hessian matrix for the multiclass logistic regres-
sion model is positive deﬁnite and so the error function again has a unique minimum.
Practical details of IRLS for the multiclass case can be found in Bishop and Nabney
(2008).

4.3.5 Probit regression
We have seen that, for a broad range of class-conditional distributions, described
by the exponential family, the resulting posterior class probabilities are given by a
logistic (or softmax) transformation acting on a linear function of the feature vari-
ables. However, not all choices of class-conditional density give rise to such a simple
form for the posterior probabilities (for instance, if the class-conditional densities are
modelled using Gaussian mixtures). This suggests that it might be worth exploring
other types of discriminative probabilistic model. For the purposes of this chapter,
however, we shall return to the two-class case, and again remain within the frame-
work of generalized linear models so that

p(t = 1|a) = f(a)
where a = wTφ, and f(·) is the activation function.

(4.111)

One way to motivate an alternative choice for the link function is to consider a
noisy threshold model, as follows. For each input φn, we evaluate an = wTφn and
then we set the target value according to

(cid:12)

tn = 1 if an (cid:2) θ
tn = 0 otherwise.

f (a), shown by the red curve. Note that the value of the blue
curve at any point, such as that indicated by the vertical green
line, corresponds to the slope of the red curve at the same point.
Conversely, the value of the red curve at this point corresponds
to the area under the blue curve indicated by the shaded green
region. In the stochastic threshold model, the class label takes
the value t = 1 if the value of a = wTφ exceeds a threshold, oth-
erwise it takes the value t = 0. This is equivalent to an activation
function given by the cumulative distribution function f (a).

eral Gaussian distribution does not change the model because this is equivalent to
a re-scaling of the linear coefﬁcients w. Many numerical packages provide for the
evaluation of a closely related function deﬁned by

(4.116)

The generalized linear model based on a probit activation function is known as probit
regression.

We can determine the parameters of this model using maximum likelihood, by a
straightforward extension of the ideas discussed earlier. In practice, the results found
using probit regression tend to be similar to those of logistic regression. We shall,

212

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

however, ﬁnd another use for the probit model when we discuss Bayesian treatments
of logistic regression in Section 4.5.

One issue that can occur in practical applications is that of outliers, which can
arise for instance through errors in measuring the input vector x or through misla-
belling of the target value t. Because such points can lie a long way to the wrong side
of the ideal decision boundary, they can seriously distort the classiﬁer. Note that the
logistic and probit regression models behave differently in this respect because the
tails of the logistic sigmoid decay asymptotically like exp(−x) for x → ∞, whereas
for the probit activation function they decay like exp(−x2), and so the probit model
can be signiﬁcantly more sensitive to outliers.

However, both the logistic and the probit models assume the data is correctly
labelled. The effect of mislabelling is easily incorporated into a probabilistic model
by introducing a probability  that the target value t has been ﬂipped to the wrong
value (Opper and Winther, 2000a), leading to a target value distribution for data point
x of the form

p(t|x) = (1 − )σ(x) + (1 − σ(x))

=  + (1 − 2)σ(x)

(4.117)
where σ(x) is the activation function with input vector x. Here  may be set in
advance, or it may be treated as a hyperparameter whose value is inferred from the
data.

4.3.6 Canonical link functions
For the linear regression model with a Gaussian noise distribution, the error
function, corresponding to the negative log likelihood, is given by (3.12). If we take
the derivative with respect to the parameter vector w of the contribution to the error
function from a data point n, this takes the form of the ‘error’ yn − tn times the
feature vector φn, where yn = wTφn. Similarly, for the combination of the logistic
sigmoid activation function and the cross-entropy error function (4.90), and for the
softmax activation function with the multiclass cross-entropy error function (4.108),
we again obtain this same simple form. We now show that this is a general result
of assuming a conditional distribution for the target variable from the exponential
family, along with a corresponding choice for the activation function known as the
canonical link function.

We again make use of the restricted form (4.84) of exponential family distribu-
tions. Note that here we are applying the assumption of exponential family distribu-
tion to the target variable t, in contrast to Section 4.2.4 where we applied it to the
input vector x. We therefore consider conditional distributions of the target variable
of the form

p(t|η, s) =

(4.118)

that the conditional mean of t, which we denote by y, is given by

y ≡ E[t|η] = −s

d
dη

ln g(η).

(4.119)

4.4. The Laplace Approximation

213

Thus y and η must related, and we denote this relation through η = ψ(y).

Following Nelder and Wedderburn (1972), we deﬁne a generalized linear model
to be one for which y is a nonlinear function of a linear combination of the input (or
feature) variables so that
y = f(wTφ)
(4.120)
where f(·) is known as the activation function in the machine learning literature, and
−1(·) is known as the link function in statistics.

4.4. The Laplace Approximation

In Section 4.5 we shall discuss the Bayesian treatment of logistic regression. As
we shall see, this is more complex than the Bayesian treatment of linear regression
models, discussed in Sections 3.3 and 3.5. In particular, we cannot integrate exactly

214

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

Chapter 11

over the parameter vector w since the posterior distribution is no longer Gaussian.
It is therefore necessary to introduce some form of approximation. Later in the
book we shall consider a range of techniques based on analytical approximations
and numerical sampling.

Here we introduce a simple, but widely used, framework called the Laplace ap-
proximation, that aims to ﬁnd a Gaussian approximation to a probability density
deﬁned over a set of continuous variables. Consider ﬁrst the case of a single contin-
uous variable z, and suppose the distribution p(z) is deﬁned by

imation q(z) which is centred on a mode of the distribution p(z). The ﬁrst step is to

ﬁnd a mode of p(z), in other words a point z0 such that p

A Gaussian distribution has the property that its logarithm is a quadratic function
of the variables. We therefore consider a Taylor expansion of ln f(z) centred on the
mode z0 so that

The Laplace approximation is illustrated in Figure 4.14. Note that the Gaussian
approximation will only be well deﬁned if its precision A > 0, in other words the
stationary point z0 must be a local maximum, so that the second derivative of f(z)
at the point z0 is negative.

distribution p(z) in yellow, together with the Laplace approximation centred on the mode z0 of p(z) in red. The
right plot shows the negative logarithms of the corresponding curves.

We can extend the Laplace method to approximate a distribution p(z) = f(z)/Z
deﬁned over an M-dimensional space z. At a stationary point z0 the gradient ∇f(z)
will vanish. Expanding around this stationary point we have

and ∇ is the gradient operator. Taking the exponential of both sides we obtain

where |A| denotes the determinant of A. This Gaussian distribution will be well
deﬁned provided its precision matrix, given by A, is positive deﬁnite, which implies
that the stationary point z0 must be a local maximum, not a minimum or a saddle
point.

(z − z0)TA(z − z0)

= N (z|z0, A−1)

In order to apply the Laplace approximation we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd the mode z0,
and then evaluate the Hessian matrix at that mode. In practice a mode will typi-
cally be found by running some form of numerical optimization algorithm (Bishop

216

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

and Nabney, 2008). Many of the distributions encountered in practice will be mul-
timodal and so there will be different Laplace approximations according to which
mode is being considered. Note that the normalization constant Z of the true distri-
bution does not need to be known in order to apply the Laplace method. As a result
of the central limit theorem, the posterior distribution for a model is expected to
become increasingly better approximated by a Gaussian as the number of observed
data points is increased, and so we would expect the Laplace approximation to be
most useful in situations where the number of data points is relatively large.

One major weakness of the Laplace approximation is that, since it is based on a
Gaussian distribution, it is only directly applicable to real variables. In other cases
it may be possible to apply the Laplace approximation to a transformation of the
variable. For instance if 0 (cid:1) τ < ∞ then we can consider a Laplace approximation
of ln τ . The most serious limitation of the Laplace framework, however, is that
it is based purely on the aspects of the true distribution at a speciﬁc value of the
variable, and so can fail to capture important global properties. In Chapter 10 we
shall consider alternative approaches which adopt a more global perspective.

4.4.1 Model comparison and BIC

where we have noted that the integrand is Gaussian and made use of the standard
result (2.43) for a normalized Gaussian distribution. We can use the result (4.135) to
obtain an approximation to the model evidence which, as discussed in Section 3.4,
plays a central role in Bayesian model comparison.
Consider a data set D and a set of models {Mi} having parameters {θi}. For
each model we deﬁne a likelihood function p(D|θi,Mi). If we introduce a prior
p(θi|Mi) over the parameters, then we are interested in computing the model evi-
dence p(D|Mi) for the various models. From now on we omit the conditioning on
Mi to keep the notation uncluttered. From Bayes’ theorem the model evidence is
given by

(cid:6)

p(D) =

p(D|θ)p(θ) dθ.

(4.136)
Identifying f(θ) = p(D|θ)p(θ) and Z = p(D), and applying the result (4.135), we

where θMAP is the value of θ at the mode of the posterior distribution, and A is the
Hessian matrix of second derivatives of the negative log posterior

A = −∇∇ ln p(D|θMAP)p(θMAP) = −∇∇ ln p(θMAP|D).

(4.138)

The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (4.137) represents the log likelihood evalu-
ated using the optimized parameters, while the remaining three terms comprise the
‘Occam factor’ which penalizes model complexity.

If we assume that the Gaussian prior distribution over parameters is broad, and
that the Hessian has full rank, then we can approximate (4.137) very roughly using

ln p(D) (cid:7) ln p(D|θMAP) − 1

2 M ln N

(4.139)

where N is the number of data points, M is the number of parameters in θ and
we have omitted additive constants. This is known as the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) or the Schwarz criterion (Schwarz, 1978). Note that, compared to
AIC given by (1.73), this penalizes model complexity more heavily.

Complexity measures such as AIC and BIC have the virtue of being easy to
evaluate, but can also give misleading results. In particular, the assumption that the
Hessian matrix has full rank is often not valid since many of the parameters are not
‘well-determined’. We can use the result (4.137) to obtain a more accurate estimate
of the model evidence starting from the Laplace approximation, as we illustrate in
the context of neural networks in Section 5.7.

4.5. Bayesian Logistic Regression

We now turn to a Bayesian treatment of logistic regression. Exact Bayesian infer-
ence for logistic regression is intractable. In particular, evaluation of the posterior
distribution would require normalization of the product of a prior distribution and a
likelihood function that itself comprises a product of logistic sigmoid functions, one
for every data point. Evaluation of the predictive distribution is similarly intractable.
Here we consider the application of the Laplace approximation to the problem of
Bayesian logistic regression (Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen, 1990; MacKay, 1992b).

4.5.1 Laplace approximation
Recall from Section 4.4 that the Laplace approximation is obtained by ﬁnding
the mode of the posterior distribution and then ﬁtting a Gaussian centred at that
mode. This requires evaluation of the second derivatives of the log posterior, which
is equivalent to ﬁnding the Hessian matrix.

Because we seek a Gaussian representation for the posterior distribution, it is

natural to begin with a Gaussian prior, which we write in the general form

p(w) = N (w|m0, S0)

(4.140)

218

4. LINEAR MODELS FOR CLASSIFICATION

where m0 and S0 are ﬁxed hyperparameters. The posterior distribution over w is
given by

(4.141)
where t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. Taking the log of both sides, and substituting for the prior
distribution using (4.140), and for the likelihood function using (4.89), we obtain

p(w|t) ∝ p(w)p(t|w)

where yn = σ(wTφn). To obtain a Gaussian approximation to the posterior dis-
tribution, we ﬁrst maximize the posterior distribution to give the MAP (maximum
posterior) solution wMAP, which deﬁnes the mean of the Gaussian. The covariance
is then given by the inverse of the matrix of second derivatives of the negative log
likelihood, which takes the form

SN = −∇∇ ln p(w|t) = S

(4.143)

The Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution therefore takes the form

q(w) = N (w|wMAP, SN ).

(4.144)

Having obtained a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution, there
remains the task of marginalizing with respect to this distribution in order to make
predictions.

4.5.2 Predictive distribution
The predictive distribution for class C1, given a new feature vector φ(x), is
obtained by marginalizing with respect to the posterior distribution p(w|t), which is
itself approximated by a Gaussian distribution q(w) so that

p(C1|φ, t) =

p(C1|φ, w)p(w|t) dw (cid:7)

(4.145)
with the corresponding probability for class C2 given by p(C2|φ, t) = 1− p(C1|φ, t).
To evaluate the predictive distribution, we ﬁrst note that the function σ(wTφ) de-
pends on w only through its projection onto φ. Denoting a = wTφ, we have

σ(wTφ)q(w) dw

(cid:6)

δ(a − wTφ)σ(a) da
where δ(·) is the Dirac delta function. From this we obtain

σ(wTφ) =

(4.146)

(cid:6)

(cid:6)

(cid:6)

(cid:6)

σ(wTφ)q(w) dw =

σ(a)p(a) da

(4.147)

where

(cid:6)

p(a) =

4.5. Bayesian Logistic Regression

219

δ(a − wTφ)q(w) dw.

(4.148)

We can evaluate p(a) by noting that the delta function imposes a linear constraint
on w and so forms a marginal distribution from the joint distribution q(w) by inte-
grating out all directions orthogonal to φ. Because q(w) is Gaussian, we know from
Section 2.3.2 that the marginal distribution will also be Gaussian. We can evaluate
the mean and covariance of this distribution by taking moments, and interchanging
the order of integration over a and w, so that

µa = E[a] =

p(a)a da =

q(w)wTφ dw = wT

Note that the distribution of a takes the same form as the predictive distribution
(3.58) for the linear regression model, with the noise variance set to zero. Thus our
variational approximation to the predictive distribution becomes

σ(a)p(a) da =

p(C1|t) =

(4.151)

(cid:6)

(cid:6)

This result can also be derived directly by making use of the results for the marginal
of a Gaussian distribution given in Section 2.3.2.

The integral over a represents the convolution of a Gaussian with a logistic sig-
moid, and cannot be evaluated analytically. We can, however, obtain a good approx-
imation (Spiegelhalter and Lauritzen, 1990; MacKay, 1992b; Barber and Bishop,
1998a) by making use of the close similarity between the logistic sigmoid function
σ(a) deﬁned by (4.59) and the probit function Φ(a) deﬁned by (4.114). In order to
obtain the best approximation to the logistic function we need to re-scale the hori-
zontal axis, so that we approximate σ(a) by Φ(λa). We can ﬁnd a suitable value of
λ by requiring that the two functions have the same slope at the origin, which gives
λ2 = π/8. The similarity of the logistic sigmoid and the probit function, for this
choice of λ, is illustrated in Figure 4.9.

The advantage of using a probit function is that its convolution with a Gaussian
can be expressed analytically in terms of another probit function. Speciﬁcally we
can show that

Note that the decision boundary corresponding to p(C1|φ, t) = 0.5 is given by

tion rate, with equal prior probabilities, then the marginalization over w has no ef-
fect. However, for more complex decision criteria it will play an important role.

was limited by the curse of dimensionality. In order to apply such models to large-
scale problems, it is necessary to adapt the basis functions to the data.

Support vector machines (SVMs), discussed in Chapter 7, address this by ﬁrst
deﬁning basis functions that are centred on the training data points and then selecting
a subset of these during training. One advantage of SVMs is that, although the
training involves nonlinear optimization, the objective function is convex, and so the
solution of the optimization problem is relatively straightforward. The number of
basis functions in the resulting models is generally much smaller than the number of
training points, although it is often still relatively large and typically increases with
the size of the training set. The relevance vector machine, discussed in Section 7.2,
also chooses a subset from a ﬁxed set of basis functions and typically results in much

225

226

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

sparser models. Unlike the SVM it also produces probabilistic outputs, although this
is at the expense of a nonconvex optimization during training.

An alternative approach is to ﬁx the number of basis functions in advance but
allow them to be adaptive, in other words to use parametric forms for the basis func-
tions in which the parameter values are adapted during training. The most successful
model of this type in the context of pattern recognition is the feed-forward neural
network, also known as the multilayer perceptron, discussed in this chapter. In fact,
‘multilayer perceptron’ is really a misnomer, because the model comprises multi-
ple layers of logistic regression models (with continuous nonlinearities) rather than
multiple perceptrons (with discontinuous nonlinearities). For many applications, the
resulting model can be signiﬁcantly more compact, and hence faster to evaluate, than
a support vector machine having the same generalization performance. The price to
be paid for this compactness, as with the relevance vector machine, is that the like-
lihood function, which forms the basis for network training, is no longer a convex
function of the model parameters. In practice, however, it is often worth investing
substantial computational resources during the training phase in order to obtain a
compact model that is fast at processing new data.

The term ‘neural network’ has its origins in attempts to ﬁnd mathematical rep-
resentations of information processing in biological systems (McCulloch and Pitts,
1943; Widrow and Hoff, 1960; Rosenblatt, 1962; Rumelhart et al., 1986). Indeed,
it has been used very broadly to cover a wide range of different models, many of
which have been the subject of exaggerated claims regarding their biological plau-
sibility. From the perspective of practical applications of pattern recognition, how-
ever, biological realism would impose entirely unnecessary constraints. Our focus in
this chapter is therefore on neural networks as efﬁcient models for statistical pattern
recognition. In particular, we shall restrict our attention to the speciﬁc class of neu-
ral networks that have proven to be of greatest practical value, namely the multilayer
perceptron.

We begin by considering the functional form of the network model, including
the speciﬁc parameterization of the basis functions, and we then discuss the prob-
lem of determining the network parameters within a maximum likelihood frame-
work, which involves the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This requires
the evaluation of derivatives of the log likelihood function with respect to the net-
work parameters, and we shall see how these can be obtained efﬁciently using the
technique of error backpropagation. We shall also show how the backpropagation
framework can be extended to allow other derivatives to be evaluated, such as the
Jacobian and Hessian matrices. Next we discuss various approaches to regulariza-
tion of neural network training and the relationships between them. We also consider
some extensions to the neural network model, and in particular we describe a gen-
eral framework for modelling conditional probability distributions known as mixture
density networks. Finally, we discuss the use of Bayesian treatments of neural net-
works. Additional background on neural network models can be found in Bishop
(1995a).

5.1. Feed-forward Network Functions

The linear models for regression and classiﬁcation discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, re-
spectively, are based on linear combinations of ﬁxed nonlinear basis functions φj(x)
and take the form

(cid:23)

(cid:22)
M(cid:2)

j=1

wjφj(x)

y(x, w) = f

(5.1)
where f(·) is a nonlinear activation function in the case of classiﬁcation and is the
identity in the case of regression. Our goal is to extend this model by making the
basis functions φj(x) depend on parameters and then to allow these parameters to
be adjusted, along with the coefﬁcients {wj}, during training. There are, of course,
many ways to construct parametric nonlinear basis functions. Neural networks use
basis functions that follow the same form as (5.1), so that each basis function is itself
a nonlinear function of a linear combination of the inputs, where the coefﬁcients in
the linear combination are adaptive parameters.

This leads to the basic neural network model, which can be described a series
of functional transformations. First we construct M linear combinations of the input
variables x1, . . . , xD in the form

weights and the parameters w
The quantities aj are known as activations. Each of them is then transformed using
a differentiable, nonlinear activation function h(·) to give

zj = h(aj).

(5.3)

These quantities correspond to the outputs of the basis functions in (5.1) that, in the
context of neural networks, are called hidden units. The nonlinear functions h(·) are
generally chosen to be sigmoidal functions such as the logistic sigmoid or the ‘tanh’
function. Following (5.1), these values are again linearly combined to give output
unit activations

where k = 1, . . . , K, and K is the total number of outputs. This transformation cor-

responds to the second layer of the network, and again the w
k0 are bias parameters.
Finally, the output unit activations are transformed using an appropriate activation
function to give a set of network outputs yk. The choice of activation function is
determined by the nature of the data and the assumed distribution of target variables

and follows the same considerations as for linear models discussed in Chapters 3 and
4. Thus for standard regression problems, the activation function is the identity so
that yk = ak. Similarly, for multiple binary classiﬁcation problems, each output unit
activation is transformed using a logistic sigmoid function so that

where

yk = σ(ak)

(5.5)

(5.6)

Finally, for multiclass problems, a softmax activation function of the form (4.62)
is used. The choice of output unit activation function is discussed in detail in Sec-
tion 5.2.

We can combine these various stages to give the overall network function that,

for sigmoidal output unit activation functions, takes the form

where the set of all weight and bias parameters have been grouped together into a
vector w. Thus the neural network model is simply a nonlinear function from a set
of input variables {xi} to a set of output variables {yk} controlled by a vector w of
adjustable parameters.

This function can be represented in the form of a network diagram as shown
in Figure 5.1. The process of evaluating (5.7) can then be interpreted as a forward
propagation of information through the network. It should be emphasized that these
diagrams do not represent probabilistic graphical models of the kind to be consid-
ered in Chapter 8 because the internal nodes represent deterministic variables rather
than stochastic ones. For this reason, we have adopted a slightly different graphical

5.1. Feed-forward Network Functions

229

notation for the two kinds of model. We shall see later how to give a probabilistic
interpretation to a neural network.

As discussed in Section 3.1, the bias parameters in (5.2) can be absorbed into
the set of weight parameters by deﬁning an additional input variable x0 whose value
is clamped at x0 = 1, so that (5.2) takes the form

We can similarly absorb the second-layer biases into the second-layer weights, so

As can be seen from Figure 5.1, the neural network model comprises two stages
of processing, each of which resembles the perceptron model of Section 4.1.7, and
for this reason the neural network is also known as the multilayer perceptron, or
MLP. A key difference compared to the perceptron, however, is that the neural net-
work uses continuous sigmoidal nonlinearities in the hidden units, whereas the per-
ceptron uses step-function nonlinearities. This means that the neural network func-
tion is differentiable with respect to the network parameters, and this property will
play a central role in network training.

If the activation functions of all the hidden units in a network are taken to be
linear, then for any such network we can always ﬁnd an equivalent network without
hidden units. This follows from the fact that the composition of successive linear
transformations is itself a linear transformation. However, if the number of hidden
units is smaller than either the number of input or output units, then the transforma-
tions that the network can generate are not the most general possible linear trans-
formations from inputs to outputs because information is lost in the dimensionality
reduction at the hidden units. In Section 12.4.2, we show that networks of linear
units give rise to principal component analysis. In general, however, there is little
interest in multilayer networks of linear units.

The network architecture shown in Figure 5.1 is the most commonly used one
in practice. However, it is easily generalized, for instance by considering additional
layers of processing each consisting of a weighted linear combination of the form
(5.4) followed by an element-wise transformation using a nonlinear activation func-
tion. Note that there is some confusion in the literature regarding the terminology
for counting the number of layers in such networks. Thus the network in Figure 5.1
may be described as a 3-layer network (which counts the number of layers of units,
and treats the inputs as units) or sometimes as a single-hidden-layer network (which
counts the number of layers of hidden units). We recommend a terminology in which
Figure 5.1 is called a two-layer network, because it is the number of layers of adap-
tive weights that is important for determining the network properties.

Another generalization of the network architecture is to include skip-layer con-
nections, each of which is associated with a corresponding adaptive parameter. For

230

instance, in a two-layer network these would go directly from inputs to outputs. In
principle, a network with sigmoidal hidden units can always mimic skip layer con-
nections (for bounded input values) by using a sufﬁciently small ﬁrst-layer weight
that, over its operating range, the hidden unit is effectively linear, and then com-
pensating with a large weight value from the hidden unit to the output. In practice,
however, it may be advantageous to include skip-layer connections explicitly.

Furthermore, the network can be sparse, with not all possible connections within
a layer being present. We shall see an example of a sparse network architecture when
we consider convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6.

Because there is a direct correspondence between a network diagram and its
mathematical function, we can develop more general network mappings by con-
sidering more complex network diagrams. However, these must be restricted to a
feed-forward architecture, in other words to one having no closed directed cycles, to
ensure that the outputs are deterministic functions of the inputs. This is illustrated
with a simple example in Figure 5.2. Each (hidden or output) unit in such a network
computes a function given by

(cid:22)(cid:2)

(cid:23)

zk = h

wkjzj

j

(5.10)

where the sum runs over all units that send connections to unit k (and a bias param-
eter is included in the summation). For a given set of values applied to the inputs of
the network, successive application of (5.10) allows the activations of all units in the
network to be evaluated including those of the output units.

The approximation properties of feed-forward networks have been widely stud-
ied (Funahashi, 1989; Cybenko, 1989; Hornik et al., 1989; Stinchecombe and White,
1989; Cotter, 1990; Ito, 1991; Hornik, 1991; Kreinovich, 1991; Ripley, 1996) and
found to be very general. Neural networks are therefore said to be universal ap-
proximators. For example, a two-layer network with linear outputs can uniformly
approximate any continuous function on a compact input domain to arbitrary accu-
racy provided the network has a sufﬁciently large number of hidden units. This result
holds for a wide range of hidden unit activation functions, but excluding polynomi-
als. Although such theorems are reassuring, the key problem is how to ﬁnd suitable
parameter values given a set of training data, and in later sections of this chapter we

layer network having 3 hidden units

linear output units. The resulting
network functions are shown by the

three dashed curves.

will show that there exist effective solutions to this problem based on both maximum
likelihood and Bayesian approaches.

The capability of a two-layer network to model a broad range of functions is
illustrated in Figure 5.3. This ﬁgure also shows how individual hidden units work
collaboratively to approximate the ﬁnal function. The role of hidden units in a simple
classiﬁcation problem is illustrated in Figure 5.4 using the synthetic classiﬁcation
data set described in Appendix A.

5.1.1 Weight-space symmetries
One property of feed-forward networks, which will play a role when we consider
Bayesian model comparison, is that multiple distinct choices for the weight vector
w can all give rise to the same mapping function from inputs to outputs (Chen et al.,
1993). Consider a two-layer network of the form shown in Figure 5.1 with M hidden
units having ‘tanh’ activation functions and full connectivity in both layers. If we
change the sign of all of the weights and the bias feeding into a particular hidden
unit, then, for a given input pattern, the sign of the activation of the hidden unit will
be reversed, because ‘tanh’ is an odd function, so that tanh(−a) = − tanh(a). This
transformation can be exactly compensated by changing the sign of all of the weights
leading out of that hidden unit. Thus, by changing the signs of a particular group of
weights (and a bias), the input–output mapping function represented by the network
is unchanged, and so we have found two different weight vectors that give rise to
the same mapping function. For M hidden units, there will be M such ‘sign-ﬂip’

symmetries, and thus any given weight vector will be one of a set 2M equivalent
weight vectors .

Similarly, imagine that we interchange the values of all of the weights (and the
bias) leading both into and out of a particular hidden unit with the corresponding
values of the weights (and bias) associated with a different hidden unit. Again, this
clearly leaves the network input–output mapping function unchanged, but it corre-
sponds to a different choice of weight vector. For M hidden units, any given weight
vector will belong to a set of M! equivalent weight vectors associated with this inter-
change symmetry, corresponding to the M! different orderings of the hidden units.
The network will therefore have an overall weight-space symmetry factor of M!2M .
For networks with more than two layers of weights, the total level of symmetry will
be given by the product of such factors, one for each layer of hidden units.

It turns out that these factors account for all of the symmetries in weight space
(except for possible accidental symmetries due to speciﬁc choices for the weight val-
ues). Furthermore, the existence of these symmetries is not a particular property of
the ‘tanh’ function but applies to a wide range of activation functions (K˙urkov´a and
Kainen, 1994). In many cases, these symmetries in weight space are of little practi-
cal consequence, although in Section 5.7 we shall encounter a situation in which we
need to take them into account.

5.2. Network Training

So far, we have viewed neural networks as a general class of parametric nonlinear
functions from a vector x of input variables to a vector y of output variables. A
simple approach to the problem of determining the network parameters is to make an
analogy with the discussion of polynomial curve ﬁtting in Section 1.1, and therefore
to minimize a sum-of-squares error function. Given a training set comprising a set
of input vectors {xn}, where n = 1, . . . , N, together with a corresponding set of

5.2. Network Training

233

N(cid:2)

n=1

target vectors {tn}, we minimize the error function

E(w) =

1
2

(cid:5)y(xn, w) − tn(cid:5)2.

(5.11)

However, we can provide a much more general view of network training by ﬁrst
giving a probabilistic interpretation to the network outputs. We have already seen
many advantages of using probabilistic predictions in Section 1.5.4. Here it will also
provide us with a clearer motivation both for the choice of output unit nonlinearity
and the choice of error function.

We start by discussing regression problems, and for the moment we consider
a single target variable t that can take any real value. Following the discussions
in Section 1.2.5 and 3.1, we assume that t has a Gaussian distribution with an x-
dependent mean, which is given by the output of the neural network, so that

p(t|x, w) = N(cid:10)

t|y(x, w), β

−1

(cid:11)

(5.12)

where β is the precision (inverse variance) of the Gaussian noise. Of course this
is a somewhat restrictive assumption, and in Section 5.6 we shall see how to extend
this approach to allow for more general conditional distributions. For the conditional
distribution given by (5.12), it is sufﬁcient to take the output unit activation function
to be the identity, because such a network can approximate any continuous function
from x to y. Given a data set of N independent, identically distributed observations
X = {x1, . . . , xN}, along with corresponding target values t = {t1, . . . , tN}, we
can construct the corresponding likelihood function

N(cid:14)

n=1

p(tn|xn, w, β).

p(t|X, w, β) =
N(cid:2)

Taking the negative logarithm, we obtain the error function

{y(xn, w) − tn}2 − N

ln(2π)

(5.13)

which can be used to learn the parameters w and β. In Section 5.7, we shall dis-
cuss the Bayesian treatment of neural networks, while here we consider a maximum
likelihood approach. Note that in the neural networks literature, it is usual to con-
sider the minimization of an error function rather than the maximization of the (log)
likelihood, and so here we shall follow this convention. Consider ﬁrst the determi-
nation of w. Maximizing the likelihood function is equivalent to minimizing the
sum-of-squares error function given by

E(w) =

1
2

{y(xn, w) − tn}2

(5.14)

N(cid:2)

n=1

234

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

where we have discarded additive and multiplicative constants. The value of w found
by minimizing E(w) will be denoted wML because it corresponds to the maximum
likelihood solution. In practice, the nonlinearity of the network function y(xn, w)
causes the error E(w) to be nonconvex, and so in practice local maxima of the
likelihood may be found, corresponding to local minima of the error function, as
discussed in Section 5.2.1.

Having found wML, the value of β can be found by minimizing the negative log

likelihood to give

βML

N

N(cid:2)

n=1

{y(xn, wML) − tn}2.

(5.15)

Note that this can be evaluated once the iterative optimization required to ﬁnd wML
is completed. If we have multiple target variables, and we assume that they are inde-
pendent conditional on x and w with shared noise precision β, then the conditional
distribution of the target values is given by

(cid:11)

t|y(x, w), β

−1I

.

(5.16)

Exercise 5.2

Following the same argument as for a single target variable, we see that the maximum
likelihood weights are determined by minimizing the sum-of-squares error function
(5.11). The noise precision is then given by

p(t|x, w) = N(cid:10)

n=1

(cid:5)y(xn, wML) − tn(cid:5)2

(5.17)

Exercise 5.3

where K is the number of target variables. The assumption of independence can be
dropped at the expense of a slightly more complex optimization problem.

Recall from Section 4.3.6 that there is a natural pairing of the error function
(given by the negative log likelihood) and the output unit activation function. In the
regression case, we can view the network as having an output activation function that
is the identity, so that yk = ak. The corresponding sum-of-squares error function
has the property

= yk − tk

∂E
∂ak

(5.18)

which we shall make use of when discussing error backpropagation in Section 5.3.
Now consider the case of binary classiﬁcation in which we have a single target
variable t such that t = 1 denotes class C1 and t = 0 denotes class C2. Following
the discussion of canonical link functions in Section 4.3.6, we consider a network
having a single output whose activation function is a logistic sigmoid

y = σ(a) ≡

1

(5.19)
so that 0 (cid:1) y(x, w) (cid:1) 1. We can interpret y(x, w) as the conditional probability
p(C1|x), with p(C2|x) given by 1 − y(x, w). The conditional distribution of targets
given inputs is then a Bernoulli distribution of the form

1 + exp(−a)

p(t|x, w) = y(x, w)t {1 − y(x, w)}1−t

.

(5.20)

5.2. Network Training

235

If we consider a training set of independent observations, then the error function,
which is given by the negative log likelihood, is then a cross-entropy error function
of the form

{tn ln yn + (1 − tn) ln(1 − yn)}

(5.21)

E(w) = − N(cid:2)

Exercise 5.4

n=1

where yn denotes y(xn, w). Note that there is no analogue of the noise precision β
because the target values are assumed to be correctly labelled. However, the model
is easily extended to allow for labelling errors. Simard et al. (2003) found that using
the cross-entropy error function instead of the sum-of-squares for a classiﬁcation
problem leads to faster training as well as improved generalization.

If we have K separate binary classiﬁcations to perform, then we can use a net-
work having K outputs each of which has a logistic sigmoid activation function.
Associated with each output is a binary class label tk ∈ {0, 1}, where k = 1, . . . , K.
If we assume that the class labels are independent, given the input vector, then the
conditional distribution of the targets is

p(t|x, w) =

yk(x, w)tk [1 − yk(x, w)]1−tk .

(5.22)

Taking the negative logarithm of the corresponding likelihood function then gives
the following error function

(5.23)

n=1

k=1

where ynk denotes yk(xn, w). Again, the derivative of the error function with re-
spect to the activation for a particular output unit takes the form (5.18) just as in the
regression case.

It is interesting to contrast the neural network solution to this problem with the
corresponding approach based on a linear classiﬁcation model of the kind discussed
in Chapter 4. Suppose that we are using a standard two-layer network of the kind
shown in Figure 5.1. We see that the weight parameters in the ﬁrst layer of the
network are shared between the various outputs, whereas in the linear model each
classiﬁcation problem is solved independently. The ﬁrst layer of the network can
be viewed as performing a nonlinear feature extraction, and the sharing of features
between the different outputs can save on computation and can also lead to improved
generalization.

Finally, we consider the standard multiclass classiﬁcation problem in which each
input is assigned to one of K mutually exclusive classes. The binary target variables
tk ∈ {0, 1} have a 1-of-K coding scheme indicating the class, and the network
outputs are interpreted as yk(x, w) = p(tk = 1|x), leading to the following error
function

for some directions in weight space. This degeneracy is removed if an appropriate
regularization term (Section 5.5) is added to the error function.

In summary, there is a natural choice of both output unit activation function
and matching error function, according to the type of problem being solved. For re-
gression we use linear outputs and a sum-of-squares error, for (multiple independent)
binary classiﬁcations we use logistic sigmoid outputs and a cross-entropy error func-
tion, and for multiclass classiﬁcation we use softmax outputs with the corresponding
multiclass cross-entropy error function. For classiﬁcation problems involving two
classes, we can use a single logistic sigmoid output, or alternatively we can use a
network with two outputs having a softmax output activation function.

We turn next to the task of ﬁnding a weight vector w which minimizes the
chosen function E(w). At this point, it is useful to have a geometrical picture of the
error function, which we can view as a surface sitting over weight space as shown in
Figure 5.5. First note that if we make a small step in weight space from w to w+ δw
then the change in the error function is δE (cid:7) δwT∇E(w), where the vector ∇E(w)
points in the direction of greatest rate of increase of the error function. Because the
error E(w) is a smooth continuous function of w, its smallest value will occur at a

Section 5.1.1

point in weight space such that the gradient of the error function vanishes, so that

5.2. Network Training

237

∇E(w) = 0

(5.26)
as otherwise we could make a small step in the direction of −∇E(w) and thereby
further reduce the error. Points at which the gradient vanishes are called stationary
points, and may be further classiﬁed into minima, maxima, and saddle points.

Our goal is to ﬁnd a vector w such that E(w) takes its smallest value. How-
ever, the error function typically has a highly nonlinear dependence on the weights
and bias parameters, and so there will be many points in weight space at which the
gradient vanishes (or is numerically very small). Indeed, from the discussion in Sec-
tion 5.1.1 we see that for any point w that is a local minimum, there will be other
points in weight space that are equivalent minima. For instance, in a two-layer net-
work of the kind shown in Figure 5.1, with M hidden units, each point in weight
space is a member of a family of M!2M equivalent points.

Furthermore, there will typically be multiple inequivalent stationary points and
in particular multiple inequivalent minima. A minimum that corresponds to the
smallest value of the error function for any weight vector is said to be a global
minimum. Any other minima corresponding to higher values of the error function
are said to be local minima. For a successful application of neural networks, it may
not be necessary to ﬁnd the global minimum (and in general it will not be known
whether the global minimum has been found) but it may be necessary to compare
several local minima in order to ﬁnd a sufﬁciently good solution.
Because there is clearly no hope of ﬁnding an analytical solution to the equa-
tion ∇E(w) = 0 we resort to iterative numerical procedures. The optimization of
continuous nonlinear functions is a widely studied problem and there exists an ex-
tensive literature on how to solve it efﬁciently. Most techniques involve choosing
some initial value w(0) for the weight vector and then moving through weight space
in a succession of steps of the form

w(τ +1) = w(τ ) + ∆w(τ )

(5.27)

where τ labels the iteration step. Different algorithms involve different choices for
the weight vector update ∆w(τ ). Many algorithms make use of gradient information
and therefore require that, after each update, the value of ∇E(w) is evaluated at
the new weight vector w(τ +1). In order to understand the importance of gradient
information, it is useful to consider a local approximation to the error function based
on a Taylor expansion.

5.2.2 Local quadratic approximation
Insight into the optimization problem, and into the various techniques for solv-
ing it, can be obtained by considering a local quadratic approximation to the error
function.

Consider the Taylor expansion of E(w) around some point(cid:1)w in weight space

E(w) (cid:7) E((cid:1)w) + (w −(cid:1)w)Tb +

(w −(cid:1)w)TH(w −(cid:1)w)

of E evaluated at(cid:1)w

.

From (5.28), the corresponding local approximation to the gradient is given by

For points w that are sufﬁciently close to (cid:1)w, these expressions will give reasonable

(5.31)

approximations for the error and its gradient.

Consider the particular case of a local quadratic approximation around a point
w(cid:1) that is a minimum of the error function. In this case there is no linear term,
because ∇E = 0 at w(cid:1), and (5.28) becomes

E(w) = E(w(cid:1)) +

(w − w(cid:1))TH(w − w(cid:1))

(5.32)

where the Hessian H is evaluated at w(cid:1). In order to interpret this geometrically,
consider the eigenvalue equation for the Hessian matrix

Hui = λiui

(5.33)

where the eigenvectors ui form a complete orthonormal set (Appendix C) so that

(5.34)
We now expand (w − w(cid:1)) as a linear combination of the eigenvectors in the form

This can be regarded as a transformation of the coordinate system in which the origin
is translated to the point w(cid:1), and the axes are rotated to align with the eigenvectors
(through the orthogonal matrix whose columns are the ui), and is discussed in more
detail in Appendix C. Substituting (5.35) into (5.32), and using (5.33) and (5.34),
allows the error function to be written in the form

In the new coordinate system, whose basis vectors are given by the eigenvectors

in Figure 5.6. For a one-dimensional weight space, a stationary point w(cid:1) will be a

The corresponding result in D-dimensions is that the Hessian matrix, evaluated at

5.2.3 Use of gradient information
As we shall see in Section 5.3, it is possible to evaluate the gradient of an error
function efﬁciently by means of the backpropagation procedure. The use of this
gradient information can lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the speed with which
the minima of the error function can be located. We can see why this is so, as follows.
In the quadratic approximation to the error function, given in (5.28), the error
surface is speciﬁed by the quantities b and H, which contain a total of W (W +
3)/2 independent elements (because the matrix H is symmetric), where W is the
dimensionality of w (i.e., the total number of adaptive parameters in the network).
The location of the minimum of this quadratic approximation therefore depends on
O(W 2) parameters, and we should not expect to be able to locate the minimum until
we have gathered O(W 2) independent pieces of information. If we do not make
use of gradient information, we would expect to have to perform O(W 2) function

Exercise 5.13

240

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

evaluations, each of which would require O(W ) steps. Thus, the computational
effort needed to ﬁnd the minimum using such an approach would be O(W 3).
Now compare this with an algorithm that makes use of the gradient information.
Because each evaluation of ∇E brings W items of information, we might hope to
ﬁnd the minimum of the function in O(W ) gradient evaluations. As we shall see,
by using error backpropagation, each such evaluation takes only O(W ) steps and so
the minimum can now be found in O(W 2) steps. For this reason, the use of gradient
information forms the basis of practical algorithms for training neural networks.

w(τ +1) = w(τ ) − η∇E(w(τ ))

5.2.4 Gradient descent optimization
The simplest approach to using gradient information is to choose the weight
update in (5.27) to comprise a small step in the direction of the negative gradient, so
that

(5.41)
where the parameter η > 0 is known as the learning rate. After each such update, the
gradient is re-evaluated for the new weight vector and the process repeated. Note that
the error function is deﬁned with respect to a training set, and so each step requires
that the entire training set be processed in order to evaluate ∇E. Techniques that
use the whole data set at once are called batch methods. At each step the weight
vector is moved in the direction of the greatest rate of decrease of the error function,
and so this approach is known as gradient descent or steepest descent. Although
such an approach might intuitively seem reasonable, in fact it turns out to be a poor
algorithm, for reasons discussed in Bishop and Nabney (2008).

For batch optimization, there are more efﬁcient methods, such as conjugate gra-
dients and quasi-Newton methods, which are much more robust and much faster
than simple gradient descent (Gill et al., 1981; Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright,
1999). Unlike gradient descent, these algorithms have the property that the error
function always decreases at each iteration unless the weight vector has arrived at a
local or global minimum.

In order to ﬁnd a sufﬁciently good minimum, it may be necessary to run a
gradient-based algorithm multiple times, each time using a different randomly cho-
sen starting point, and comparing the resulting performance on an independent vali-
dation set.

There is, however, an on-line version of gradient descent that has proved useful
in practice for training neural networks on large data sets (Le Cun et al., 1989).
Error functions based on maximum likelihood for a set of independent observations
comprise a sum of terms, one for each data point

N(cid:2)

n=1

E(w) =

En(w).

(5.42)

On-line gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent or stochastic
gradient descent, makes an update to the weight vector based on one data point at a
time, so that

w(τ +1) = w(τ ) − η∇En(w(τ )).

(5.43)

5.3. Error Backpropagation

241

This update is repeated by cycling through the data either in sequence or by selecting
points at random with replacement. There are of course intermediate scenarios in
which the updates are based on batches of data points.

One advantage of on-line methods compared to batch methods is that the former
handle redundancy in the data much more efﬁciently. To see, this consider an ex-
treme example in which we take a data set and double its size by duplicating every
data point. Note that this simply multiplies the error function by a factor of 2 and so
is equivalent to using the original error function. Batch methods will require double
the computational effort to evaluate the batch error function gradient, whereas on-
line methods will be unaffected. Another property of on-line gradient descent is the
possibility of escaping from local minima, since a stationary point with respect to
the error function for the whole data set will generally not be a stationary point for
each data point individually.

Nonlinear optimization algorithms, and their practical application to neural net-

work training, are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney (2008).

5.3. Error Backpropagation

Our goal in this section is to ﬁnd an efﬁcient technique for evaluating the gradient
of an error function E(w) for a feed-forward neural network. We shall see that
this can be achieved using a local message passing scheme in which information is
sent alternately forwards and backwards through the network and is known as error
backpropagation, or sometimes simply as backprop.

It should be noted that the term backpropagation is used in the neural com-
puting literature to mean a variety of different things. For instance, the multilayer
perceptron architecture is sometimes called a backpropagation network. The term
backpropagation is also used to describe the training of a multilayer perceptron us-
ing gradient descent applied to a sum-of-squares error function. In order to clarify
the terminology, it is useful to consider the nature of the training process more care-
fully. Most training algorithms involve an iterative procedure for minimization of an
error function, with adjustments to the weights being made in a sequence of steps. At
each such step, we can distinguish between two distinct stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the
derivatives of the error function with respect to the weights must be evaluated. As
we shall see, the important contribution of the backpropagation technique is in pro-
viding a computationally efﬁcient method for evaluating such derivatives. Because
it is at this stage that errors are propagated backwards through the network, we shall
use the term backpropagation speciﬁcally to describe the evaluation of derivatives.
In the second stage, the derivatives are then used to compute the adjustments to be
made to the weights. The simplest such technique, and the one originally considered
by Rumelhart et al. (1986), involves gradient descent. It is important to recognize
that the two stages are distinct. Thus, the ﬁrst stage, namely the propagation of er-
rors backwards through the network in order to evaluate derivatives, can be applied
to many other kinds of network and not just the multilayer perceptron. It can also be
applied to error functions other that just the simple sum-of-squares, and to the eval-

242

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

uation of other derivatives such as the Jacobian and Hessian matrices, as we shall
see later in this chapter. Similarly, the second stage of weight adjustment using the
calculated derivatives can be tackled using a variety of optimization schemes, many
of which are substantially more powerful than simple gradient descent.

5.3.1 Evaluation of error-function derivatives
We now derive the backpropagation algorithm for a general network having ar-
bitrary feed-forward topology, arbitrary differentiable nonlinear activation functions,
and a broad class of error function. The resulting formulae will then be illustrated
using a simple layered network structure having a single layer of sigmoidal hidden
units together with a sum-of-squares error.

Many error functions of practical interest, for instance those deﬁned by maxi-
mum likelihood for a set of i.i.d. data, comprise a sum of terms, one for each data
point in the training set, so that

Here we shall consider the problem of evaluating ∇En(w) for one such term in the
error function. This may be used directly for sequential optimization, or the results
can be accumulated over the training set in the case of batch methods.

n=1

En(w).

Consider ﬁrst a simple linear model in which the outputs yk are linear combina-

tions of the input variables xi so that

yk =

wkixi

(5.45)

together with an error function that, for a particular input pattern n, takes the form

En =

k

(ynk − tnk)2

= (ynj − tnj)xni

∂En
∂wji

(5.46)

(5.47)

where ynk = yk(xn, w). The gradient of this error function with respect to a weight
wji is given by

which can be interpreted as a ‘local’ computation involving the product of an ‘error
signal’ ynj − tnj associated with the output end of the link wji and the variable xni
associated with the input end of the link. In Section 4.3.2, we saw how a similar
formula arises with the logistic sigmoid activation function together with the cross
entropy error function, and similarly for the softmax activation function together
with its matching cross-entropy error function. We shall now see how this simple
result extends to the more complex setting of multilayer feed-forward networks.

In a general feed-forward network, each unit computes a weighted sum of its

(cid:2)

inputs of the form

aj =

wjizi

i

(5.48)

5.3. Error Backpropagation

243

where zi is the activation of a unit, or input, that sends a connection to unit j, and wji
is the weight associated with that connection. In Section 5.1, we saw that biases can
be included in this sum by introducing an extra unit, or input, with activation ﬁxed
at +1. We therefore do not need to deal with biases explicitly. The sum in (5.48) is
transformed by a nonlinear activation function h(·) to give the activation zj of unit j
in the form

zj = h(aj).

(5.49)

Note that one or more of the variables zi in the sum in (5.48) could be an input, and
similarly, the unit j in (5.49) could be an output.

For each pattern in the training set, we shall suppose that we have supplied the
corresponding input vector to the network and calculated the activations of all of
the hidden and output units in the network by successive application of (5.48) and
(5.49). This process is often called forward propagation because it can be regarded
as a forward ﬂow of information through the network.

Now consider the evaluation of the derivative of En with respect to a weight
wji. The outputs of the various units will depend on the particular input pattern n.
However, in order to keep the notation uncluttered, we shall omit the subscript n
from the network variables. First we note that En depends on the weight wji only
via the summed input aj to unit j. We can therefore apply the chain rule for partial
derivatives to give

We now introduce a useful notation

δj ≡ ∂En
∂aj

∂En
∂wji

= ∂En
∂aj

∂aj
∂wji

.

(5.50)

(5.51)

where the δ’s are often referred to as errors for reasons we shall see shortly. Using
(5.48), we can write

∂aj
∂wji

= zi.

Substituting (5.51) and (5.52) into (5.50), we then obtain

∂En
∂wji

= δjzi.

(5.52)

(5.53)

Equation (5.53) tells us that the required derivative is obtained simply by multiplying
the value of δ for the unit at the output end of the weight by the value of z for the unit
at the input end of the weight (where z = 1 in the case of a bias). Note that this takes
the same form as for the simple linear model considered at the start of this section.
Thus, in order to evaluate the derivatives, we need only to calculate the value of δj
for each hidden and output unit in the network, and then apply (5.53).

As we have seen already, for the output units, we have

δk = yk − tk

(5.54)

(5.55)

(cid:2)

where the sum runs over all units k to which unit j sends connections. The arrange-
ment of units and weights is illustrated in Figure 5.7. Note that the units labelled k
could include other hidden units and/or output units. In writing down (5.55), we are
making use of the fact that variations in aj give rise to variations in the error func-
tion only through variations in the variables ak. If we now substitute the deﬁnition
of δ given by (5.51) into (5.55), and make use of (5.48) and (5.49), we obtain the
following backpropagation formula

δj = h

(cid:4)(aj)

wkjδk

k

(5.56)

which tells us that the value of δ for a particular hidden unit can be obtained by
propagating the δ’s backwards from units higher up in the network, as illustrated
in Figure 5.7. Note that the summation in (5.56) is taken over the ﬁrst index on
wkj (corresponding to backward propagation of information through the network),
whereas in the forward propagation equation (5.10) it is taken over the second index.
Because we already know the values of the δ’s for the output units, it follows that
by recursively applying (5.56) we can evaluate the δ’s for all of the hidden units in a
feed-forward network, regardless of its topology.

The backpropagation procedure can therefore be summarized as follows.

Error Backpropagation

1. Apply an input vector xn to the network and forward propagate through
the network using (5.48) and (5.49) to ﬁnd the activations of all the hidden
and output units.

2. Evaluate the δk for all the output units using (5.54).
3. Backpropagate the δ’s using (5.56) to obtain δj for each hidden unit in the

network.

4. Use (5.53) to evaluate the required derivatives.

5.3. Error Backpropagation

245

For batch methods, the derivative of the total error E can then be obtained by
repeating the above steps for each pattern in the training set and then summing over
all patterns:

∂E
∂wji

=

∂En
∂wji

.

(5.57)

(cid:2)

n

In the above derivation we have implicitly assumed that each hidden or output unit in
the network has the same activation function h(·). The derivation is easily general-
ized, however, to allow different units to have individual activation functions, simply
by keeping track of which form of h(·) goes with which unit.

5.3.2 A simple example
The above derivation of the backpropagation procedure allowed for general
forms for the error function, the activation functions, and the network topology. In
order to illustrate the application of this algorithm, we shall consider a particular
example. This is chosen both for its simplicity and for its practical importance, be-
cause many applications of neural networks reported in the literature make use of
this type of network. Speciﬁcally, we shall consider a two-layer network of the form
illustrated in Figure 5.1, together with a sum-of-squares error, in which the output
units have linear activation functions, so that yk = ak, while the hidden units have
logistic sigmoid activation functions given by

where

(5.58)

(5.64)

A useful feature of this function is that its derivative can be expressed in a par-

We also consider a standard sum-of-squares error function, so that for pattern n the
error is given by

h

(cid:4)(a) = 1 − h(a)2.

(yk − tk)2

(5.61)

where yk is the activation of output unit k, and tk is the corresponding target, for a
particular input pattern xn.

For each pattern in the training set in turn, we ﬁrst perform a forward propagation

using

5.3.3 Efﬁciency of backpropagation
One of the most important aspects of backpropagation is its computational efﬁ-
ciency. To understand this, let us examine how the number of computer operations
required to evaluate the derivatives of the error function scales with the total number
W of weights and biases in the network. A single evaluation of the error function
(for a given input pattern) would require O(W ) operations, for sufﬁciently large W .
This follows from the fact that, except for a network with very sparse connections,
the number of weights is typically much greater than the number of units, and so the
bulk of the computational effort in forward propagation is concerned with evaluat-
ing the sums in (5.48), with the evaluation of the activation functions representing a
small overhead. Each term in the sum in (5.48) requires one multiplication and one
addition, leading to an overall computational cost that is O(W ).

An alternative approach to backpropagation for computing the derivatives of the
error function is to use ﬁnite differences. This can be done by perturbing each weight
in turn, and approximating the derivatives by the expression

= En(wji + ) − En(wji)

∂En
∂wji

(5.68)
where  (cid:13) 1. In a software simulation, the accuracy of the approximation to the
derivatives can be improved by making  smaller, until numerical roundoff problems
arise. The accuracy of the ﬁnite differences method can be improved signiﬁcantly
by using symmetrical central differences of the form



+ O()

= En(wji + ) − En(wji − )

2

∂En
∂wji

+ O(2).

(5.69)

Exercise 5.14

In this case, the O() corrections cancel, as can be veriﬁed by Taylor expansion on
the right-hand side of (5.69), and so the residual corrections are O(2). The number
of computational steps is, however, roughly doubled compared with (5.68).

The main problem with numerical differentiation is that the highly desirable
O(W ) scaling has been lost. Each forward propagation requires O(W ) steps, and

lier modules in the system.

there are W weights in the network each of which must be perturbed individually, so
that the overall scaling is O(W 2).

However, numerical differentiation plays an important role in practice, because a
comparison of the derivatives calculated by backpropagation with those obtained us-
ing central differences provides a powerful check on the correctness of any software
implementation of the backpropagation algorithm. When training networks in prac-
tice, derivatives should be evaluated using backpropagation, because this gives the
greatest accuracy and numerical efﬁciency. However, the results should be compared
with numerical differentiation using (5.69) for some test cases in order to check the
correctness of the implementation.

5.3.4 The Jacobian matrix
We have seen how the derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights
can be obtained by the propagation of errors backwards through the network. The
technique of backpropagation can also be applied to the calculation of other deriva-
tives. Here we consider the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix, whose elements are
given by the derivatives of the network outputs with respect to the inputs

Jki ≡ ∂yk
∂xi

(5.70)

where each such derivative is evaluated with all other inputs held ﬁxed. Jacobian
matrices play a useful role in systems built from a number of distinct modules, as
illustrated in Figure 5.8. Each module can comprise a ﬁxed or adaptive function,
which can be linear or nonlinear, so long as it is differentiable. Suppose we wish
to minimize an error function E with respect to the parameter w in Figure 5.8. The
derivative of the error function is given by

(cid:2)

k,j

∂E
∂w

∂E
∂yk

∂yk
∂zj

∂w

(5.71)

in which the Jacobian matrix for the red module in Figure 5.8 appears in the middle
term.

Because the Jacobian matrix provides a measure of the local sensitivity of the
outputs to changes in each of the input variables, it also allows any known errors ∆xi

248

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

(cid:2)

associated with the inputs to be propagated through the trained network in order to
estimate their contribution ∆yk to the errors at the outputs, through the relation

∆yk (cid:7)

∂yk
∂xi

∆xi

(5.72)
which is valid provided the |∆xi| are small. In general, the network mapping rep-
resented by a trained neural network will be nonlinear, and so the elements of the
Jacobian matrix will not be constants but will depend on the particular input vector
used. Thus (5.72) is valid only for small perturbations of the inputs, and the Jacobian
itself must be re-evaluated for each new input vector.

i

The Jacobian matrix can be evaluated using a backpropagation procedure that is
similar to the one derived earlier for evaluating the derivatives of an error function
with respect to the weights. We start by writing the element Jki in the form

where we have made use of (5.48). The sum in (5.73) runs over all units j to which
the input unit i sends connections (for example, over all units in the ﬁrst hidden
layer in the layered topology considered earlier). We now write down a recursive
backpropagation formula to determine the derivatives ∂yk/∂aj

(5.74)

where the sum runs over all units l to which unit j sends connections (corresponding
to the ﬁrst index of wlj). Again, we have made use of (5.48) and (5.49). This
backpropagation starts at the output units for which the required derivatives can be
found directly from the functional form of the output-unit activation function. For
instance, if we have individual sigmoidal activation functions at each output unit,
then

∂yk

whereas for softmax outputs we have

(5.75)

(5.76)

We can summarize the procedure for evaluating the Jacobian matrix as follows.
Apply the input vector corresponding to the point in input space at which the Ja-
cobian matrix is to be found, and forward propagate in the usual way to obtain the

5.4. The Hessian Matrix

activations of all of the hidden and output units in the network. Next, for each row
k of the Jacobian matrix, corresponding to the output unit k, backpropagate using
the recursive relation (5.74), starting with (5.75) or (5.76), for all of the hidden units
in the network. Finally, use (5.73) to do the backpropagation to the inputs. The
Jacobian can also be evaluated using an alternative forward propagation formalism,
which can be derived in an analogous way to the backpropagation approach given
here.

Again, the implementation of such algorithms can be checked by using numeri-

which involves 2D forward propagations for a network having D inputs.

5.4. The Hessian Matrix

We have shown how the technique of backpropagation can be used to obtain the ﬁrst
derivatives of an error function with respect to the weights in the network. Back-
propagation can also be used to evaluate the second derivatives of the error, given
by

∂2E

∂wji∂wlk

.

(5.78)

Note that it is sometimes convenient to consider all of the weight and bias parameters
as elements wi of a single vector, denoted w, in which case the second derivatives
form the elements Hij of the Hessian matrix H, where i, j ∈ {1, . . . , W} and W is
the total number of weights and biases. The Hessian plays an important role in many
aspects of neural computing, including the following:

1. Several nonlinear optimization algorithms used for training neural networks
are based on considerations of the second-order properties of the error surface,
which are controlled by the Hessian matrix (Bishop and Nabney, 2008).

2. The Hessian forms the basis of a fast procedure for re-training a feed-forward

network following a small change in the training data (Bishop, 1991).

3. The inverse of the Hessian has been used to identify the least signiﬁcant weights

in a network as part of network ‘pruning’ algorithms (Le Cun et al., 1990).

4. The Hessian plays a central role in the Laplace approximation for a Bayesian
neural network (see Section 5.7). Its inverse is used to determine the predic-
tive distribution for a trained network, its eigenvalues determine the values of
hyperparameters, and its determinant is used to evaluate the model evidence.

Various approximation schemes have been used to evaluate the Hessian matrix
for a neural network. However, the Hessian can also be calculated exactly using an
extension of the backpropagation technique.

250

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

An important consideration for many applications of the Hessian is the efﬁciency
with which it can be evaluated. If there are W parameters (weights and biases) in the
network, then the Hessian matrix has dimensions W × W and so the computational
effort needed to evaluate the Hessian will scale like O(W 2) for each pattern in the
data set. As we shall see, there are efﬁcient methods for evaluating the Hessian
whose scaling is indeed O(W 2).

5.4.1 Diagonal approximation
Some of the applications for the Hessian matrix discussed above require the
inverse of the Hessian, rather than the Hessian itself. For this reason, there has
been some interest in using a diagonal approximation to the Hessian, in other words
one that simply replaces the off-diagonal elements with zeros, because its inverse is
trivial to evaluate. Again, we shall consider an error function that consists of a sum
of terms, one for each pattern in the data set, so that E =
n En. The Hessian can
then be obtained by considering one pattern at a time, and then summing the results
over all patterns. From (5.48), the diagonal elements of the Hessian, for pattern n,
can be written

(cid:5)

∂2En

∂a2

(5.79)

Using (5.48) and (5.49), the second derivatives on the right-hand side of (5.79) can
be found recursively using the chain rule of differential calculus to give a backprop-
agation equation of the form

∂2En

(5.80)

If we now neglect off-diagonal elements in the second-derivative terms, we obtain

(5.81)

Note that the number of computational steps required to evaluate this approximation
is O(W ), where W is the total number of weight and bias parameters in the network,
compared with O(W 2) for the full Hessian.

Ricotti et al. (1988) also used the diagonal approximation to the Hessian, but
they retained all terms in the evaluation of ∂2En/∂a2
j and so obtained exact expres-
sions for the diagonal terms. Note that this no longer has O(W ) scaling. The major
problem with diagonal approximations, however, is that in practice the Hessian is
typically found to be strongly nondiagonal, and so these approximations, which are
driven mainly be computational convenience, must be treated with care.

5.4. The Hessian Matrix

5.4.2 Outer product approximation
When neural networks are applied to regression problems, it is common to use

a sum-of-squares error function of the form

Exercise 5.16

Exercise 5.17

Exercise 5.19

N(cid:2)

where we have considered the case of a single output in order to keep the notation
simple (the extension to several outputs is straightforward). We can then write the
Hessian matrix in the form

H = ∇∇E =

∇yn∇yn +

(yn − tn)∇∇yn.

(5.83)

n=1

n=1

If the network has been trained on the data set, and its outputs yn happen to be very
close to the target values tn, then the second term in (5.83) will be small and can
be neglected. More generally, however, it may be appropriate to neglect this term
by the following argument. Recall from Section 1.5.5 that the optimal function that
minimizes a sum-of-squares loss is the conditional average of the target data. The
quantity (yn − tn) is then a random variable with zero mean. If we assume that its
value is uncorrelated with the value of the second derivative term on the right-hand
side of (5.83), then the whole term will average to zero in the summation over n.

By neglecting the second term in (5.83), we arrive at the Levenberg–Marquardt
approximation or outer product approximation (because the Hessian matrix is built
up from a sum of outer products of vectors), given by

bnbT
n

n=1

(5.84)
where bn = ∇yn = ∇an because the activation function for the output units is
simply the identity. Evaluation of the outer product approximation for the Hessian
is straightforward as it only involves ﬁrst derivatives of the error function, which
can be evaluated efﬁciently in O(W ) steps using standard backpropagation. The
elements of the matrix can then be found in O(W 2) steps by simple multiplication.
It is important to emphasize that this approximation is only likely to be valid for a
network that has been trained appropriately, and that for a general network mapping
the second derivative terms on the right-hand side of (5.83) will typically not be
negligible.

In the case of the cross-entropy error function for a network with logistic sigmoid

output-unit activation functions, the corresponding approximation is given by

H (cid:7) N(cid:2)

H (cid:7) N(cid:2)

252

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

5.4.3 Inverse Hessian
We can use the outer-product approximation to develop a computationally ef-
ﬁcient procedure for approximating the inverse of the Hessian (Hassibi and Stork,
1993). First we write the outer-product approximation in matrix notation as

N(cid:2)

bnbT
n

HN =

(5.86)
where bn ≡ ∇wan is the contribution to the gradient of the output unit activation
arising from data point n. We now derive a sequential procedure for building up the
Hessian by including data points one at a time. Suppose we have already obtained
the inverse Hessian using the ﬁrst L data points. By separating off the contribution
from data point L + 1, we obtain

n=1

In order to evaluate the inverse of the Hessian, we now consider the matrix identity

(cid:10)

M + vvT

L+1.

HL+1 = HL + bL+1bT

(cid:11)−1 = M−1 − (M−1v)

(cid:10)

vTM−1
1 + vTM−1v

(cid:11)

(5.87)

(5.88)

where I is the unit matrix, which is simply a special case of the Woodbury identity
(C.7). If we now identify HL with M and bL+1 with v, we obtain

−1
L+1 = H

L − H

L bL+1

1 + bT

.

(5.89)

Exercise 5.21

In this way, data points are sequentially absorbed until L+1 = N and the whole data
set has been processed. This result therefore represents a procedure for evaluating
the inverse of the Hessian using a single pass through the data set. The initial matrix
H0 is chosen to be αI, where α is a small quantity, so that the algorithm actually
ﬁnds the inverse of H + αI. The results are not particularly sensitive to the precise
value of α. Extension of this algorithm to networks having more than one output is
straightforward.

We note here that the Hessian matrix can sometimes be calculated indirectly as
part of the network training algorithm. In particular, quasi-Newton nonlinear opti-
mization algorithms gradually build up an approximation to the inverse of the Hes-
sian during training. Such algorithms are discussed in detail in Bishop and Nabney
(2008).

5.4.4 Finite differences
As in the case of the ﬁrst derivatives of the error function, we can ﬁnd the second
derivatives by using ﬁnite differences, with accuracy limited by numerical precision.
If we perturb each possible pair of weights in turn, we obtain

∂wji∂wlk

∂2E

=

1
42

{E(wji + , wlk + ) − E(wji + , wlk − )
−E(wji − , wlk + ) + E(wji − , wlk − )} + O(2).

(5.90)

5.4. The Hessian Matrix

253

Again, by using a symmetrical central differences formulation, we ensure that the
residual errors are O(2) rather than O(). Because there are W 2 elements in the
Hessian matrix, and because the evaluation of each element requires four forward
propagations each needing O(W ) operations (per pattern), we see that this approach
will require O(W 3) operations to evaluate the complete Hessian. It therefore has
poor scaling properties, although in practice it is very useful as a check on the soft-
ware implementation of backpropagation methods.

A more efﬁcient version of numerical differentiation can be found by applying
central differences to the ﬁrst derivatives of the error function, which are themselves
calculated using backpropagation. This gives

(5.91)

Because there are now only W weights to be perturbed, and because the gradients
can be evaluated in O(W ) steps, we see that this method gives the Hessian in O(W 2)
operations.

5.4.5 Exact evaluation of the Hessian
So far, we have considered various approximation schemes for evaluating the
Hessian matrix or its inverse. The Hessian can also be evaluated exactly, for a net-
work of arbitrary feed-forward topology, using extension of the technique of back-
propagation used to evaluate ﬁrst derivatives, which shares many of its desirable
features including computational efﬁciency (Bishop, 1991; Bishop, 1992). It can be
applied to any differentiable error function that can be expressed as a function of
the network outputs and to networks having arbitrary differentiable activation func-
tions. The number of computational steps needed to evaluate the Hessian scales
like O(W 2). Similar algorithms have also been considered by Buntine and Weigend
(1993).

Here we consider the speciﬁc case of a network having two layers of weights,
(cid:4)
for which the required equations are easily derived. We shall use indices i and i
to
to denote inputs, indices j and j
denote outputs. We ﬁrst deﬁne

to denoted hidden units, and indices k and k

Mkk(cid:1) ≡ ∂2En

where En is the contribution to the error from data point n. The Hessian matrix for
this network can then be considered in three separate blocks as follows.

Here Ijj(cid:1) is the j, j
element of the identity matrix. If one or both of the weights is
a bias term, then the corresponding expressions are obtained simply by setting the
appropriate activation(s) to 1. Inclusion of skip-layer connections is straightforward.

5.4.6 Fast multiplication by the Hessian
For many applications of the Hessian, the quantity of interest is not the Hessian
matrix H itself but the product of H with some vector v. We have seen that the
evaluation of the Hessian takes O(W 2) operations, and it also requires storage that is
O(W 2). The vector vTH that we wish to calculate, however, has only W elements,
so instead of computing the Hessian as an intermediate step, we can instead try to
ﬁnd an efﬁcient approach to evaluating vTH directly in a way that requires only
O(W ) operations.

To do this, we ﬁrst note that

vTH = vT∇(∇E)

(5.96)
where ∇ denotes the gradient operator in weight space. We can then write down
the standard forward-propagation and backpropagation equations for the evaluation
of ∇E and apply (5.96) to these equations to give a set of forward-propagation and
backpropagation equations for the evaluation of vTH (Møller, 1993; Pearlmutter,
1994). This corresponds to acting on the original forward-propagation and back-
propagation equations with a differential operator vT∇. Pearlmutter (1994) used the
notation R{·} to denote the operator vT∇, and we shall follow this convention. The
analysis is straightforward and makes use of the usual rules of differential calculus,
together with the result

R{w} = v.

(5.97)

The technique is best illustrated with a simple example, and again we choose a
two-layer network of the form shown in Figure 5.1, with linear output units and a
sum-of-squares error function. As before, we consider the contribution to the error
function from one pattern in the data set. The required vector is then obtained as

5.4. The Hessian Matrix

usual by summing over the contributions from each of the patterns separately. For
the two-layer network, the forward-propagation equations are given by

(cid:2)

i

j

aj =

wjixi

zj = h(aj)
yk =

(5.98)

(5.99)

(5.100)

We now act on these equations using the R{·} operator to obtain a set of forward
propagation equations in the form
R{aj} =
R{zj} = h
R{yk} =

(cid:2)
(cid:2)

where vji is the element of the vector v that corresponds to the weight wji. Quan-
tities of the form R{zj}, R{aj} and R{yk} are to be regarded as new variables
whose values are found using the above equations.

Because we are considering a sum-of-squares error function, we have the fol-

lowing standard backpropagation expressions:
δk = yk − tk
(cid:4)(aj)
δj = h

(cid:2)

wkjδk.

(5.104)
(5.105)

Again, we act on these equations with the R{·} operator to obtain a set of backprop-

(5.108)

and acting on these with the R{·} operator, we obtain expressions for the elements
of the vector vTH

The implementation of this algorithm involves the introduction of additional
variables R{aj}, R{zj} and R{δj} for the hidden units and R{δk} and R{yk}
for the output units. For each input pattern, the values of these quantities can be
found using the above results, and the elements of vTH are then given by (5.110)
and (5.111). An elegant aspect of this technique is that the equations for evaluating
vTH mirror closely those for standard forward and backward propagation, and so the
extension of existing software to compute this product is typically straightforward.
If desired, the technique can be used to evaluate the full Hessian matrix by
choosing the vector v to be given successively by a series of unit vectors of the
form (0, 0, . . . , 1, . . . , 0) each of which picks out one column of the Hessian. This
leads to a formalism that is analytically equivalent to the backpropagation procedure
of Bishop (1992), as described in Section 5.4.5, though with some loss of efﬁciency
due to redundant calculations.

5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks

The number of input and outputs units in a neural network is generally determined
by the dimensionality of the data set, whereas the number M of hidden units is a free
parameter that can be adjusted to give the best predictive performance. Note that M
controls the number of parameters (weights and biases) in the network, and so we
might expect that in a maximum likelihood setting there will be an optimum value
of M that gives the best generalization performance, corresponding to the optimum
balance between under-ﬁtting and over-ﬁtting. Figure 5.9 shows an example of the
effect of different values of M for the sinusoidal regression problem.

The generalization error, however, is not a simple function of M due to the
presence of local minima in the error function, as illustrated in Figure 5.10. Here
we see the effect of choosing multiple random initializations for the weight vector
for a range of values of M. The overall best validation set performance in this
case occurred for a particular solution having M = 8. In practice, one approach to
choosing M is in fact to plot a graph of the kind shown in Figure 5.10 and then to
choose the speciﬁc solution having the smallest validation set error.

There are, however, other ways to control the complexity of a neural network
model in order to avoid over-ﬁtting. From our discussion of polynomial curve ﬁtting
in Chapter 1, we see that an alternative approach is to choose a relatively large value
for M and then to control complexity by the addition of a regularization term to the
error function. The simplest regularizer is the quadratic, giving a regularized error

(5.112)

This regularizer is also known as weight decay and has been discussed at length
in Chapter 3. The effective model complexity is then determined by the choice of
the regularization coefﬁcient λ. As we have seen previously, this regularizer can be
interpreted as the negative logarithm of a zero-mean Gaussian prior distribution over
the weight vector w.

5.5.1 Consistent Gaussian priors
One of the limitations of simple weight decay in the form (5.112) is that is
inconsistent with certain scaling properties of network mappings. To illustrate this,
consider a multilayer perceptron network having two layers of weights and linear
output units, which performs a mapping from a set of input variables {xi} to a set
of output variables {yk}. The activations of the hidden units in the ﬁrst hidden layer

ized by sampling from an isotropic

of zero and a variance of 10.

Then we can arrange for the mapping performed by the network to be unchanged

Similarly, a linear transformation of the output variables of the network of the form

can be achieved by making a transformation of the second-layer weights and biases
using

If we train one network using the original data and one network using data for which
the input and/or target variables are transformed by one of the above linear transfor-
mations, then consistency requires that we should obtain equivalent networks that
differ only by the linear transformation of the weights as given. Any regularizer
should be consistent with this property, otherwise it arbitrarily favours one solution
over another, equivalent one. Clearly, simple weight decay (5.112), that treats all
weights and biases on an equal footing, does not satisfy this property.

We therefore look for a regularizer which is invariant under the linear trans-
formations (5.116), (5.117), (5.119) and (5.120). These require that the regularizer
should be invariant to re-scaling of the weights and to shifts of the biases. Such a
regularizer is given by

(5.121)
where W1 denotes the set of weights in the ﬁrst layer, W2 denotes the set of weights
in the second layer, and biases are excluded from the summations. This regularizer

Note that priors of this form are improper (they cannot be normalized) because the
bias parameters are unconstrained. The use of improper priors can lead to difﬁculties
in selecting regularization coefﬁcients and in model comparison within the Bayesian
framework, because the corresponding evidence is zero. It is therefore common to
include separate priors for the biases (which then break shift invariance) having their
own hyperparameters. We can illustrate the effect of the resulting four hyperpa-
rameters by drawing samples from the prior and plotting the corresponding network
functions, as shown in Figure 5.11.

More generally, we can consider priors in which the weights are divided into

As a special case of this prior, if we choose the groups to correspond to the sets
of weights associated with each of the input units, and we optimize the marginal
likelihood with respect to the corresponding parameters αk, we obtain automatic
relevance determination as discussed in Section 7.2.2.

5.5.2 Early stopping
An alternative to regularization as a way of controlling the effective complexity
of a network is the procedure of early stopping. The training of nonlinear network
models corresponds to an iterative reduction of the error function deﬁned with re-
spect to a set of training data. For many of the optimization algorithms used for
network training, such as conjugate gradients, the error is a nonincreasing function
of the iteration index. However, the error measured with respect to independent data,
generally called a validation set, often shows a decrease at ﬁrst, followed by an in-
crease as the network starts to over-ﬁt. Training can therefore be stopped at the point
of smallest error with respect to the validation data set, as indicated in Figure 5.12,
in order to obtain a network having good generalization performance.

The behaviour of the network in this case is sometimes explained qualitatively
in terms of the effective number of degrees of freedom in the network, in which this
number starts out small and then to grows during the training process, corresponding
to a steady increase in the effective complexity of the model. Halting training before

a minimum of the training error has been reached then represents a way of limiting
the effective network complexity.

In the case of a quadratic error function, we can verify this insight, and show
that early stopping should exhibit similar behaviour to regularization using a sim-
ple weight-decay term. This can be understood from Figure 5.13, in which the axes
in weight space have been rotated to be parallel to the eigenvectors of the Hessian
matrix. If, in the absence of weight decay, the weight vector starts at the origin and
proceeds during training along a path that follows the local negative gradient vec-
tor, then the weight vector will move initially parallel to the w2 axis through a point

corresponding roughly to (cid:4)w and then move towards the minimum of the error func-
eigenvalues of the Hessian. Stopping at a point near(cid:4)w is therefore similar to weight

tion wML. This follows from the shape of the error surface and the widely differing

decay. The relationship between early stopping and weight decay can be made quan-
titative, thereby showing that the quantity τ η (where τ is the iteration index, and η
is the learning rate parameter) plays the role of the reciprocal of the regularization

parameter λ. The effective number of parameters in the network therefore grows
during the course of training.

5.5.3 Invariances
In many applications of pattern recognition, it is known that predictions should
be unchanged, or invariant, under one or more transformations of the input vari-
ables. For example, in the classiﬁcation of objects in two-dimensional images, such
as handwritten digits, a particular object should be assigned the same classiﬁcation
irrespective of its position within the image (translation invariance) or of its size
(scale invariance). Such transformations produce signiﬁcant changes in the raw
data, expressed in terms of the intensities at each of the pixels in the image, and
yet should give rise to the same output from the classiﬁcation system. Similarly
in speech recognition, small levels of nonlinear warping along the time axis, which
preserve temporal ordering, should not change the interpretation of the signal.

If sufﬁciently large numbers of training patterns are available, then an adaptive
model such as a neural network can learn the invariance, at least approximately. This
involves including within the training set a sufﬁciently large number of examples of
the effects of the various transformations. Thus, for translation invariance in an im-
age, the training set should include examples of objects at many different positions.
This approach may be impractical, however, if the number of training examples
is limited, or if there are several invariants (because the number of combinations of
transformations grows exponentially with the number of such transformations). We
therefore seek alternative approaches for encouraging an adaptive model to exhibit
the required invariances. These can broadly be divided into four categories:

1. The training set is augmented using replicas of the training patterns, trans-
formed according to the desired invariances. For instance, in our digit recog-
nition example, we could make multiple copies of each example in which the

262

early stopping can give similar

ror function.
If the weight vector

cording to the local negative gra-

stopping training early, a weight
vector ew is found that is qual-
itatively similar to that obtained

mum of the regularized error, as
can be seen by comparing with

digit is shifted to a different position in each image.

2. A regularization term is added to the error function that penalizes changes in
the model output when the input is transformed. This leads to the technique of
tangent propagation, discussed in Section 5.5.4.

3. Invariance is built into the pre-processing by extracting features that are invari-
ant under the required transformations. Any subsequent regression or classi-
ﬁcation system that uses such features as inputs will necessarily also respect
these invariances.

4. The ﬁnal option is to build the invariance properties into the structure of a neu-
ral network (or into the deﬁnition of a kernel function in the case of techniques
such as the relevance vector machine). One way to achieve this is through the
use of local receptive ﬁelds and shared weights, as discussed in the context of
convolutional neural networks in Section 5.5.6.

Approach 1 is often relatively easy to implement and can be used to encourage com-
plex invariances such as those illustrated in Figure 5.14. For sequential training
algorithms, this can be done by transforming each input pattern before it is presented
to the model so that, if the patterns are being recycled, a different transformation
(drawn from an appropriate distribution) is added each time. For batch methods, a
similar effect can be achieved by replicating each data point a number of times and
transforming each copy independently. The use of such augmented data can lead to
signiﬁcant improvements in generalization (Simard et al., 2003), although it can also
be computationally costly.

Approach 2 leaves the data set unchanged but modiﬁes the error function through
the addition of a regularizer. In Section 5.5.5, we shall show that this approach is
closely related to approach 2.

5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks

Figure 5.14 Illustration of the synthetic warping of a handwritten digit. The original image is shown on the
left. On the right, the top row shows three examples of warped digits, with the corresponding displacement
ﬁelds shown on the bottom row. These displacement ﬁelds are generated by sampling random displacements
∆x, ∆y ∈ (0, 1) at each pixel and then smoothing by convolution with Gaussians of width 0.01, 30 and 60
respectively.

One advantage of approach 3 is that it can correctly extrapolate well beyond the
range of transformations included in the training set. However, it can be difﬁcult
to ﬁnd hand-crafted features with the required invariances that do not also discard
information that can be useful for discrimination.

5.5.4 Tangent propagation
We can use regularization to encourage models to be invariant to transformations
of the input through the technique of tangent propagation (Simard et al., 1992).
Consider the effect of a transformation on a particular input vector xn. Provided the
transformation is continuous (such as translation or rotation, but not mirror reﬂection
for instance), then the transformed pattern will sweep out a manifold M within the
D-dimensional input space. This is illustrated in Figure 5.15, for the case of D =
2 for simplicity. Suppose the transformation is governed by a single parameter ξ
(which might be rotation angle for instance). Then the subspace M swept out by xn

tion on a particular input vector xn. A one-
dimensional transformation, parameterized by
the continuous variable ξ, applied to xn causes
it to sweep out a one-dimensional manifold M.
Locally, the effect of the transformation can be
approximated by the tangent vector τ n.

will be one-dimensional, and will be parameterized by ξ. Let the vector that results
from acting on xn by this transformation be denoted by s(xn, ξ), which is deﬁned
so that s(x, 0) = x. Then the tangent to the curve M is given by the directional
derivative τ = ∂s/∂ξ, and the tangent vector at the point xn is given by

τ n = ∂s(xn, ξ)

Under a transformation of the input vector, the network output vector will, in general,

The result (5.126) can be used to modify the standard error function, so as to encour-
age local invariance in the neighbourhood of the data points, by the addition to the
original error function E of a regularization function Ω to give a total error function

Exercise 5.26

The regularization function will be zero when the network mapping function is in-
variant under the transformation in the neighbourhood of each pattern vector, and
the value of the parameter λ determines the balance between ﬁtting the training data
and learning the invariance property.

In a practical implementation, the tangent vector τ n can be approximated us-
ing ﬁnite differences, by subtracting the original vector xn from the corresponding
vector after transformation using a small value of ξ, and then dividing by ξ. This is
illustrated in Figure 5.16.

The regularization function depends on the network weights through the Jaco-
bian J. A backpropagation formalism for computing the derivatives of the regu-
larizer with respect to the network weights is easily obtained by extension of the
techniques introduced in Section 5.3.

If the transformation is governed by L parameters (e.g., L = 3 for the case of
translations combined with in-plane rotations in a two-dimensional image), then the
manifold M will have dimensionality L, and the corresponding regularizer is given
by the sum of terms of the form (5.128), one for each transformation. If several
transformations are considered at the same time, and the network mapping is made
invariant to each separately, then it will be (locally) invariant to combinations of the
transformations (Simard et al., 1992).

A related technique, called tangent distance, can be used to build invariance
properties into distance-based methods such as nearest-neighbour classiﬁers (Simard
et al., 1993).

5.5.5 Training with transformed data
We have seen that one way to encourage invariance of a model to a set of trans-
formations is to expand the training set using transformed versions of the original
input patterns. Here we show that this approach is closely related to the technique of
tangent propagation (Bishop, 1995b; Leen, 1995).

As in Section 5.5.4, we shall consider a transformation governed by a single
parameter ξ and described by the function s(x, ξ), with s(x, 0) = x. We shall
also consider a sum-of-squares error function. The error function for untransformed
inputs can be written (in the inﬁnite data set limit) in the form
{y(x) − t}2p(t|x)p(x) dx dt

(cid:6)(cid:6)

(5.129)

E =

as discussed in Section 1.5.5. Here we have considered a network having a single
output, in order to keep the notation uncluttered.
If we now consider an inﬁnite
number of copies of each data point, each of which is perturbed by the transformation

266

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

in which the parameter ξ is drawn from a distribution p(ξ), then the error function
deﬁned over this expanded data set can be written as

{y(s(x, ξ)) − t}2p(t|x)p(x)p(ξ) dx dt dξ.

(5.130)

(cid:6)(cid:6)(cid:6)

(cid:4)E =

We now assume that the distribution p(ξ) has zero mean with small variance, so that
we are only considering small transformations of the original input vectors. We can
then expand the transformation function as a Taylor series in powers of ξ to give

Because the distribution of transformations has zero mean we have E[ξ] = 0. Also,
we shall denote E[ξ2] by λ. Omitting terms of O(ξ3), the average error function then
becomes

(5.131)
where E is the original sum-of-squares error, and the regularization term Ω takes the
form

(cid:4)E = E + λΩ

5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks

267

We can further simplify this regularization term as follows. In Section 1.5.5 we
saw that the function that minimizes the sum-of-squares error is given by the condi-
tional average E[t|x] of the target values t. From (5.131) we see that the regularized
error will equal the unregularized sum-of-squares plus terms which are O(ξ), and so
the network function that minimizes the total error will have the form

y(x) = E[t|x] + O(ξ).

(5.133)

Thus, to leading order in ξ, the ﬁrst term in the regularizer vanishes and we are left
with

which is equivalent to the tangent propagation regularizer (5.128).
If we consider the special case in which the transformation of the inputs simply
consists of the addition of random noise, so that x → x + ξ, then the regularizer
takes the form

(cid:6)

Ω =

2

(cid:5)∇y(x)(cid:5)2

p(x) dx

(5.135)

which is known as Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977; Bishop,
1995b). Derivatives of this regularizer with respect to the network weights can be
found using an extended backpropagation algorithm (Bishop, 1993). We see that, for
small noise amplitudes, Tikhonov regularization is related to the addition of random
noise to the inputs, which has been shown to improve generalization in appropriate
circumstances (Sietsma and Dow, 1991).

5.5.6 Convolutional networks
Another approach to creating models that are invariant to certain transformation
of the inputs is to build the invariance properties into the structure of a neural net-
work. This is the basis for the convolutional neural network (Le Cun et al., 1989;
LeCun et al., 1998), which has been widely applied to image data.

Consider the speciﬁc task of recognizing handwritten digits. Each input image
comprises a set of pixel intensity values, and the desired output is a posterior proba-
bility distribution over the ten digit classes. We know that the identity of the digit is
invariant under translations and scaling as well as (small) rotations. Furthermore, the
network must also exhibit invariance to more subtle transformations such as elastic
deformations of the kind illustrated in Figure 5.14. One simple approach would be to
treat the image as the input to a fully connected network, such as the kind shown in
Figure 5.1. Given a sufﬁciently large training set, such a network could in principle
yield a good solution to this problem and would learn the appropriate invariances by
example.

However, this approach ignores a key property of images, which is that nearby
pixels are more strongly correlated than more distant pixels. Many of the modern
approaches to computer vision exploit this property by extracting local features that
depend only on small subregions of the image. Information from such features can
then be merged in later stages of processing in order to detect higher-order features

and ultimately to yield information about the image as whole. Also, local features
that are useful in one region of the image are likely to be useful in other regions of
the image, for instance if the object of interest is translated.

These notions are incorporated into convolutional neural networks through three
mechanisms: (i) local receptive ﬁelds, (ii) weight sharing, and (iii) subsampling. The
structure of a convolutional network is illustrated in Figure 5.17. In the convolutional
layer the units are organized into planes, each of which is called a feature map. Units
in a feature map each take inputs only from a small subregion of the image, and all
of the units in a feature map are constrained to share the same weight values. For
instance, a feature map might consist of 100 units arranged in a 10 × 10 grid, with
each unit taking inputs from a 5×5 pixel patch of the image. The whole feature map
therefore has 25 adjustable weight parameters plus one adjustable bias parameter.
Input values from a patch are linearly combined using the weights and the bias, and
the result transformed by a sigmoidal nonlinearity using (5.1). If we think of the units
as feature detectors, then all of the units in a feature map detect the same pattern but
at different locations in the input image. Due to the weight sharing, the evaluation
of the activations of these units is equivalent to a convolution of the image pixel
intensities with a ‘kernel’ comprising the weight parameters. If the input image is
shifted, the activations of the feature map will be shifted by the same amount but will
otherwise be unchanged. This provides the basis for the (approximate) invariance of

5.5. Regularization in Neural Networks

269

the network outputs to translations and distortions of the input image. Because we
will typically need to detect multiple features in order to build an effective model,
there will generally be multiple feature maps in the convolutional layer, each having
its own set of weight and bias parameters.

The outputs of the convolutional units form the inputs to the subsampling layer
of the network. For each feature map in the convolutional layer, there is a plane of
units in the subsampling layer and each unit takes inputs from a small receptive ﬁeld
in the corresponding feature map of the convolutional layer. These units perform
subsampling. For instance, each subsampling unit might take inputs from a 2 × 2
unit region in the corresponding feature map and would compute the average of
those inputs, multiplied by an adaptive weight with the addition of an adaptive bias
parameter, and then transformed using a sigmoidal nonlinear activation function.
The receptive ﬁelds are chosen to be contiguous and nonoverlapping so that there
are half the number of rows and columns in the subsampling layer compared with
the convolutional layer. In this way, the response of a unit in the subsampling layer
will be relatively insensitive to small shifts of the image in the corresponding regions
of the input space.

In a practical architecture, there may be several pairs of convolutional and sub-
sampling layers. At each stage there is a larger degree of invariance to input trans-
formations compared to the previous layer. There may be several feature maps in a
given convolutional layer for each plane of units in the previous subsampling layer,
so that the gradual reduction in spatial resolution is then compensated by an increas-
ing number of features. The ﬁnal layer of the network would typically be a fully
connected, fully adaptive layer, with a softmax output nonlinearity in the case of
multiclass classiﬁcation.

The whole network can be trained by error minimization using backpropagation
to evaluate the gradient of the error function. This involves a slight modiﬁcation
of the usual backpropagation algorithm to ensure that the shared-weight constraints
are satisﬁed. Due to the use of local receptive ﬁelds, the number of weights in
the network is smaller than if the network were fully connected. Furthermore, the
number of independent parameters to be learned from the data is much smaller still,
due to the substantial numbers of constraints on the weights.

5.5.7 Soft weight sharing
One way to reduce the effective complexity of a network with a large number
of weights is to constrain weights within certain groups to be equal. This is the
technique of weight sharing that was discussed in Section 5.5.6 as a way of building
translation invariance into networks used for image interpretation. It is only appli-
cable, however, to particular problems in which the form of the constraints can be
speciﬁed in advance. Here we consider a form of soft weight sharing (Nowlan and
Hinton, 1992) in which the hard constraint of equal weights is replaced by a form
of regularization in which groups of weights are encouraged to have similar values.
Furthermore, the division of weights into groups, the mean weight value for each
group, and the spread of values within the groups are all determined as part of the
learning process.

Exercise 5.28

270

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

Exercise 5.29

Recall that the simple weight decay regularizer, given in (5.112), can be viewed
as the negative log of a Gaussian prior distribution over the weights. We can encour-
age the weight values to form several groups, rather than just one group, by consid-
ering instead a probability distribution that is a mixture of Gaussians. The centres
and variances of the Gaussian components, as well as the mixing coefﬁcients, will be
considered as adjustable parameters to be determined as part of the learning process.
Thus, we have a probability density of the form

(cid:14)

p(w) =

p(wi)

where

where λ is the regularization coefﬁcient. This error is minimized both with respect
to the weights wi and with respect to the parameters {πj, µj, σj} of the mixture
model. If the weights were constant, then the parameters of the mixture model could
be determined by using the EM algorithm discussed in Chapter 9. However, the dis-
tribution of weights is itself evolving during the learning process, and so to avoid nu-
merical instability, a joint optimization is performed simultaneously over the weights
and the mixture-model parameters. This can be done using a standard optimization
algorithm such as conjugate gradients or quasi-Newton methods.

In order to minimize the total error function, it is necessary to be able to evaluate
its derivatives with respect to the various adjustable parameters. To do this it is con-
venient to regard the {πj} as prior probabilities and to introduce the corresponding
posterior probabilities which, following (2.192), are given by Bayes’ theorem in the
form

γj(w) =

The derivatives of the total error function with respect to the weights are then given

The effect of the regularization term is therefore to pull each weight towards the
centre of the jth Gaussian, with a force proportional to the posterior probability of
that Gaussian for the given weight. This is precisely the kind of effect that we are
seeking.

by the posterior probability that each weight is generated by component j. Note that
in a practical implementation, new variables ηj deﬁned by

σ2
j = exp(ηj)

(5.144)

are introduced, and the minimization is performed with respect to the ηj. This en-
sures that the parameters σj remain positive. It also has the effect of discouraging
pathological solutions in which one or more of the σj goes to zero, corresponding
to a Gaussian component collapsing onto one of the weight parameter values. Such
solutions are discussed in more detail in the context of Gaussian mixture models in
Section 9.2.1.

For the derivatives with respect to the mixing coefﬁcients πj, we need to take

account of the constraints (cid:2)

πj = 1,

in which the Cartesian coordinates (x1, x2) of the end ef-

is know as the forward kinematics of the arm.
In prac-

5.6. Mixture Density Networks

Exercise 5.33

The goal of supervised learning is to model a conditional distribution p(t|x), which
for many simple regression problems is chosen to be Gaussian. However, practical
machine learning problems can often have signiﬁcantly non-Gaussian distributions.
These can arise, for example, with inverse problems in which the distribution can be
multimodal, in which case the Gaussian assumption can lead to very poor predic-
tions.

As a simple example of an inverse problem, consider the kinematics of a robot
arm, as illustrated in Figure 5.18. The forward problem involves ﬁnding the end ef-
fector position given the joint angles and has a unique solution. However, in practice
we wish to move the end effector of the robot to a speciﬁc position, and to do this we
must set appropriate joint angles. We therefore need to solve the inverse problem,
which has two solutions as seen in Figure 5.18.

Forward problems often corresponds to causality in a physical system and gen-
erally have a unique solution. For instance, a speciﬁc pattern of symptoms in the
human body may be caused by the presence of a particular disease. In pattern recog-
nition, however, we typically have to solve an inverse problem, such as trying to
predict the presence of a disease given a set of symptoms. If the forward problem
involves a many-to-one mapping, then the inverse problem will have multiple solu-
tions. For instance, several different diseases may result in the same symptoms.

In the robotics example, the kinematics is deﬁned by geometrical equations, and
the multimodality is readily apparent. However, in many machine learning problems
the presence of multimodality, particularly in problems involving spaces of high di-
mensionality, can be less obvious. For tutorial purposes, however, we shall consider
a simple toy problem for which we can easily visualize the multimodality. Data for
this problem is generated by sampling a variable x uniformly over the interval (0, 1),
to give a set of values {xn}, and the corresponding target values tn are obtained

Figure 5.19 On the left is the data
set for a simple ‘forward problem’ in
which the red curve shows the result
of ﬁtting a two-layer neural network
by minimizing the sum-of-squares
error function. The corresponding
inverse problem, shown on the right,
is obtained by exchanging the roles
of x and t. Here the same net-
work trained again by minimizing the
sum-of-squares error function gives
a very poor ﬁt to the data due to the
multimodality of the data set.

by computing the function xn + 0.3 sin(2πxn) and then adding uniform noise over
the interval (−0.1, 0.1). The inverse problem is then obtained by keeping the same
data points but exchanging the roles of x and t. Figure 5.19 shows the data sets for
the forward and inverse problems, along with the results of ﬁtting two-layer neural
networks having 6 hidden units and a single linear output unit by minimizing a sum-
of-squares error function. Least squares corresponds to maximum likelihood under
a Gaussian assumption. We see that this leads to a very poor model for the highly
non-Gaussian inverse problem.
We therefore seek a general framework for modelling conditional probability
distributions. This can be achieved by using a mixture model for p(t|x) in which
both the mixing coefﬁcients as well as the component densities are ﬂexible functions
of the input vector x, giving rise to the mixture density network. For any given value
of x, the mixture model provides a general formalism for modelling an arbitrary
conditional density function p(t|x). Provided we consider a sufﬁciently ﬂexible
network, we then have a framework for approximating arbitrary conditional distri-
butions.

Here we shall develop the model explicitly for Gaussian components, so that

K(cid:2)

πk(x)N(cid:10)

p(t|x) =

(cid:11)

t|µk(x), σ2

k(x)

.

(5.148)

k=1

This is an example of a heteroscedastic model since the noise variance on the data
is a function of the input vector x. Instead of Gaussians, we can use other distribu-
tions for the components, such as Bernoulli distributions if the target variables are
binary rather than continuous. We have also specialized to the case of isotropic co-
variances for the components, although the mixture density network can readily be
extended to allow for general covariance matrices by representing the covariances
using a Cholesky factorization (Williams, 1996). Even with isotropic components,
the conditional distribution p(t|x) does not assume factorization with respect to the
components of t (in contrast to the standard sum-of-squares regression model) as a
consequence of the mixture distribution.

We now take the various parameters of the mixture model, namely the mixing
k(x), to be governed by

coefﬁcients πk(x), the means µk(x), and the variances σ2

the outputs of a conventional neural network that takes x as its input. The structure
of this mixture density network is illustrated in Figure 5.20. The mixture density
network is closely related to the mixture of experts discussed in Section 14.5.3. The
principle difference is that in the mixture density network the same function is used
to predict the parameters of all of the component densities as well as the mixing co-
efﬁcients, and so the nonlinear hidden units are shared amongst the input-dependent
functions.

The neural network in Figure 5.20 can, for example, be a two-layer network
having sigmoidal (‘tanh’) hidden units. If there are L components in the mixture
model (5.148), and if t has K components, then the network will have L output unit
activations denoted by aπ
k that determine the mixing coefﬁcients πk(x), K outputs
k that determine the kernel widths σk(x), and L × K outputs denoted
denoted by aσ
µ
kj that determine the components µkj(x) of the kernel centres µk(x). The total
by a
number of network outputs is given by (K + 2)L, as compared with the usual K
outputs for a network, which simply predicts the conditional means of the target
variables.

The mixing coefﬁcients must satisfy the constraints

πk(x) = 1,

which can be achieved using a set of softmax outputs

Similarly, the variances must satisfy σ2
of the exponentials of the corresponding network activations using

k(x) (cid:2) 0 and so can be represented in terms

σk(x) = exp(aσ

k).

(5.151)

Finally, because the means µk(x) have real components, they can be represented

5.6. Mixture Density Networks

directly by the network output activations

µ
µkj(x) = a
kj.

(5.152)

The adaptive parameters of the mixture density network comprise the vector w
of weights and biases in the neural network, that can be set by maximum likelihood,
or equivalently by minimizing an error function deﬁned to be the negative logarithm
of the likelihood. For independent data, this error function takes the form

where we have made the dependencies on w explicit.

In order to minimize the error function, we need to calculate the derivatives of
the error E(w) with respect to the components of w. These can be evaluated by
using the standard backpropagation procedure, provided we obtain suitable expres-
sions for the derivatives of the error with respect to the output-unit activations. These
represent error signals δ for each pattern and for each output unit, and can be back-
propagated to the hidden units and the error function derivatives evaluated in the
usual way. Because the error function (5.153) is composed of a sum of terms, one
for each training data point, we can consider the derivatives for a particular pattern
n and then ﬁnd the derivatives of E by summing over all patterns.

Because we are dealing with mixture distributions, it is convenient to view the
mixing coefﬁcients πk(x) as x-dependent prior probabilities and to introduce the
corresponding posterior probabilities given by

We illustrate the use of a mixture density network by returning to the toy ex-
ample of an inverse problem shown in Figure 5.19. Plots of the mixing coefﬁ-
cients πk(x), the means µk(x), and the conditional density contours corresponding
to p(t|x), are shown in Figure 5.21. The outputs of the neural network, and hence the
parameters in the mixture model, are necessarily continuous single-valued functions
of the input variables. However, we see from Figure 5.21(c) that the model is able to
produce a conditional density that is unimodal for some values of x and trimodal for
other values by modulating the amplitudes of the mixing components πk(x).

Once a mixture density network has been trained, it can predict the conditional
density function of the target data for any given value of the input vector. This
conditional density represents a complete description of the generator of the data, so
far as the problem of predicting the value of the output vector is concerned. From
this density function we can calculate more speciﬁc quantities that may be of interest
in different applications. One of the simplest of these is the mean, corresponding to
the conditional average of the target data, and is given by

where we have used (5.148). Because a standard network trained by least squares
is approximating the conditional mean, we see that a mixture density network can
reproduce the conventional least-squares result as a special case. Of course, as we
have already noted, for a multimodal distribution the conditional mean is of limited
value.

We can similarly evaluate the variance of the density function about the condi-

tional average, to give

s2(x) = E

=

where we have used (5.148) and (5.158). This is more general than the corresponding
least-squares result because the variance is a function of x.

We have seen that for multimodal distributions, the conditional mean can give
a poor representation of the data. For instance, in controlling the simple robot arm
shown in Figure 5.18, we need to pick one of the two possible joint angle settings
in order to achieve the desired end-effector location, whereas the average of the two
solutions is not itself a solution.
In such cases, the conditional mode may be of
more value. Because the conditional mode for the mixture density network does not
have a simple analytical solution, this would require numerical iteration. A simple
alternative is to take the mean of the most probable component (i.e., the one with the
largest mixing coefﬁcient) at each value of x. This is shown for the toy data set in
Figure 5.21(d).

5.7. Bayesian Neural Networks

So far, our discussion of neural networks has focussed on the use of maximum like-
lihood to determine the network parameters (weights and biases). Regularized max-
imum likelihood can be interpreted as a MAP (maximum posterior) approach in
which the regularizer can be viewed as the logarithm of a prior parameter distribu-
tion. However, in a Bayesian treatment we need to marginalize over the distribution
of parameters in order to make predictions.

In Section 3.3, we developed a Bayesian solution for a simple linear regression
model under the assumption of Gaussian noise. We saw that the posterior distribu-
tion, which is Gaussian, could be evaluated exactly and that the predictive distribu-
tion could also be found in closed form. In the case of a multilayered network, the
highly nonlinear dependence of the network function on the parameter values means
that an exact Bayesian treatment can no longer be found. In fact, the log of the pos-
terior distribution will be nonconvex, corresponding to the multiple local minima in
the error function.

The technique of variational inference, to be discussed in Chapter 10, has been
applied to Bayesian neural networks using a factorized Gaussian approximation

278

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

to the posterior distribution (Hinton and van Camp, 1993) and also using a full-
covariance Gaussian (Barber and Bishop, 1998a; Barber and Bishop, 1998b). The
most complete treatment, however, has been based on the Laplace approximation
(MacKay, 1992c; MacKay, 1992b) and forms the basis for the discussion given here.
We will approximate the posterior distribution by a Gaussian, centred at a mode of
the true posterior. Furthermore, we shall assume that the covariance of this Gaus-
sian is small so that the network function is approximately linear with respect to the
parameters over the region of parameter space for which the posterior probability is
signiﬁcantly nonzero. With these two approximations, we will obtain models that
are analogous to the linear regression and classiﬁcation models discussed in earlier
chapters and so we can exploit the results obtained there. We can then make use of
the evidence framework to provide point estimates for the hyperparameters and to
compare alternative models (for example, networks having different numbers of hid-
den units). To start with, we shall discuss the regression case and then later consider
the modiﬁcations needed for solving classiﬁcation tasks.

5.7.1 Posterior parameter distribution
Consider the problem of predicting a single continuous target variable t from
a vector x of inputs (the extension to multiple targets is straightforward). We shall
suppose that the conditional distribution p(t|x) is Gaussian, with an x-dependent
mean given by the output of a neural network model y(x, w), and with precision
(inverse variance) β

p(t|x, w, β) = N (t|y(x, w), β

−1).

(5.161)

Similarly, we shall choose a prior distribution over the weights w that is Gaussian of
the form

(5.162)
For an i.i.d. data set of N observations x1, . . . , xN , with a corresponding set of target
values D = {t1, . . . , tN}, the likelihood function is given by

p(w|α) = N (w|0, α

−1I).

N(cid:14)

p(D|w, β) =

N (tn|y(xn, w), β

−1)

n=1

and so the resulting posterior distribution is then

p(w|D, α, β) ∝ p(w|α)p(D|w, β).

(5.163)

(5.164)

which, as a consequence of the nonlinear dependence of y(x, w) on w, will be non-
Gaussian.

We can ﬁnd a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution by using the
Laplace approximation. To do this, we must ﬁrst ﬁnd a (local) maximum of the
posterior, and this must be done using iterative numerical optimization. As usual, it
is convenient to maximize the logarithm of the posterior, which can be written in the

5.7. Bayesian Neural Networks

279

form

ln p(w|D) = − α
2

wTw − β
2

N(cid:2)

n=1

{y(xn, w) − tn}2 + const

(5.165)

which corresponds to a regularized sum-of-squares error function. Assuming for
the moment that α and β are ﬁxed, we can ﬁnd a maximum of the posterior, which
we denote wMAP, by standard nonlinear optimization algorithms such as conjugate
gradients, using error backpropagation to evaluate the required derivatives.

Having found a mode wMAP, we can then build a local Gaussian approximation
by evaluating the matrix of second derivatives of the negative log posterior distribu-
tion. From (5.165), this is given by

A = −∇∇ ln p(w|D, α, β) = αI + βH

(5.166)

where H is the Hessian matrix comprising the second derivatives of the sum-of-
squares error function with respect to the components of w. Algorithms for comput-
ing and approximating the Hessian were discussed in Section 5.4. The corresponding
Gaussian approximation to the posterior is then given from (4.134) by

q(w|D) = N (w|wMAP, A−1).

(5.167)

Similarly, the predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing with respect

to this posterior distribution

p(t|x,D) =

(cid:6)

p(t|x, w)q(w|D) dw.

(5.168)

However, even with the Gaussian approximation to the posterior, this integration is
still analytically intractable due to the nonlinearity of the network function y(x, w)
as a function of w. To make progress, we now assume that the posterior distribution
has small variance compared with the characteristic scales of w over which y(x, w)
is varying. This allows us to make a Taylor series expansion of the network function
around wMAP and retain only the linear terms

y(x, w) (cid:7) y(x, wMAP) + gT(w − wMAP)

(5.169)

where we have deﬁned

g = ∇wy(x, w)|w=wMAP .

(5.170)
With this approximation, we now have a linear-Gaussian model with a Gaussian
distribution for p(w) and a Gaussian for p(t|w) whose mean is a linear function of
w of the form

t|y(x, wMAP) + gT(w − wMAP), β

−1

.

(5.171)

p(t|x, w, β) (cid:7) N(cid:10)

(cid:11)

(cid:11)

Exercise 5.38

We can therefore make use of the general result (2.115) for the marginal p(t) to give

p(t|x,D, α, β) = N(cid:10)

t|y(x, wMAP), σ2(x)

(5.172)

280

5. NEURAL NETWORKS

where the input-dependent variance is given by

−1 + gTA−1g.

σ2(x) = β

(5.173)
We see that the predictive distribution p(t|x,D) is a Gaussian whose mean is given
by the network function y(x, wMAP) with the parameter set to their MAP value. The
variance has two terms, the ﬁrst of which arises from the intrinsic noise on the target
variable, whereas the second is an x-dependent term that expresses the uncertainty
in the interpolant due to the uncertainty in the model parameters w. This should
be compared with the corresponding predictive distribution for the linear regression
model, given by (3.58) and (3.59).

5.7.2 Hyperparameter optimization
So far, we have assumed that the hyperparameters α and β are ﬁxed and known.
We can make use of the evidence framework, discussed in Section 3.5, together with
the Gaussian approximation to the posterior obtained using the Laplace approxima-
tion, to obtain a practical procedure for choosing the values of such hyperparameters.
The marginal likelihood, or evidence, for the hyperparameters is obtained by

integrating over the network weights
p(D|α, β) =

(cid:6)

p(D|w, β)p(w|α) dw.

(5.174)

Exercise 5.39

This is easily evaluated by making use of the Laplace approximation result (4.135).
Taking logarithms then gives
ln p(D|α, β) (cid:7) −E(wMAP) − 1

ln|A| + W

ln β − N

ln α + N

where W is the total number of parameters in w, and the regularized error function
is deﬁned by

n=1

E(wMAP) = β

{y(xn, wMAP) − tn}2 + α

wT

MAPwMAP.

(5.176)

We see that this takes the same form as the corresponding result (3.86) for the linear
regression model.
In the evidence framework, we make point estimates for α and β by maximizing
ln p(D|α, β). Consider ﬁrst the maximization with respect to α, which can be done
by analogy with the linear regression case discussed in Section 3.5.2. We ﬁrst deﬁne
the eigenvalue equation

(5.177)
where H is the Hessian matrix comprising the second derivatives of the sum-of-
squares error function, evaluated at w = wMAP. By analogy with (3.92), we obtain

βHui = λiui

(5.179)

Note that this result was exact for the linear regression case. For the nonlinear neural
network, however, it ignores the fact that changes in α will cause changes in the
Hessian H, which in turn will change the eigenvalues. We have therefore implicitly
ignored terms involving the derivatives of λi with respect to α.

Similarly, from (3.95) we see that maximizing the evidence with respect to β

As with the linear model, we need to alternate between re-estimation of the hyper-
parameters α and β and updating of the posterior distribution. The situation with
a neural network model is more complex, however, due to the multimodality of the
posterior distribution. As a consequence, the solution for wMAP found by maximiz-
ing the log posterior will depend on the initialization of w. Solutions that differ only
as a consequence of the interchange and sign reversal symmetries in the hidden units
are identical so far as predictions are concerned, and it is irrelevant which of the
equivalent solutions is found. However, there may be inequivalent solutions as well,
and these will generally yield different values for the optimized hyperparameters.
In order to compare different models, for example neural networks having differ-
ent numbers of hidden units, we need to evaluate the model evidence p(D). This can
be approximated by taking (5.175) and substituting the values of α and β obtained
from the iterative optimization of these hyperparameters. A more careful evaluation
is obtained by marginalizing over α and β, again by making a Gaussian approxima-
tion (MacKay, 1992c; Bishop, 1995a). In either case, it is necessary to evaluate the
determinant |A| of the Hessian matrix. This can be problematic in practice because
the determinant, unlike the trace, is sensitive to the small eigenvalues that are often
difﬁcult to determine accurately.

The Laplace approximation is based on a local quadratic expansion around a
mode of the posterior distribution over weights. We have seen in Section 5.1.1 that
any given mode in a two-layer network is a member of a set of M!2M equivalent
modes that differ by interchange and sign-change symmetries, where M is the num-
ber of hidden units. When comparing networks having different numbers of hid-
den units, this can be taken into account by multiplying the evidence by a factor of
M!2M .

5.7.3 Bayesian neural networks for classiﬁcation
So far, we have used the Laplace approximation to develop a Bayesian treat-
ment of neural network regression models. We now discuss the modiﬁcations to

this framework that arise when it is applied to classiﬁcation. Here we shall con-
sider a network having a single logistic sigmoid output corresponding to a two-class
classiﬁcation problem. The extension to networks with multiclass softmax outputs
is straightforward. We shall build extensively on the analogous results for linear
classiﬁcation models discussed in Section 4.5, and so we encourage the reader to
familiarize themselves with that material before studying this section.

The log likelihood function for this model is given by

ln p(D|w) =

= 1N {tn ln yn + (1 − tn) ln(1 − yn)}

(5.181)

n

where tn ∈ {0, 1} are the target values, and yn ≡ y(xn, w). Note that there is no
hyperparameter β, because the data points are assumed to be correctly labelled. As
before, the prior is taken to be an isotropic Gaussian of the form (5.162).

The ﬁrst stage in applying the Laplace framework to this model is to initialize
the hyperparameter α, and then to determine the parameter vector w by maximizing
the log posterior distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing the regularized error
function

E(w) = − ln p(D|w) + α

and can be achieved using error backpropagation combined with standard optimiza-
tion algorithms, as discussed in Section 5.3.

Having found a solution wMAP for the weight vector, the next step is to eval-
uate the Hessian matrix H comprising the second derivatives of the negative log
likelihood function. This can be done, for instance, using the exact method of Sec-
tion 5.4.5, or using the outer product approximation given by (5.85). The second
derivatives of the negative log posterior can again be written in the form (5.166), and
the Gaussian approximation to the posterior is then given by (5.167).

To optimize the hyperparameter α, we again maximize the marginal likelihood,

which is easily shown to take the form
ln p(D|α) (cid:7) −E(wMAP) − 1

where the regularized error function is deﬁned by

in which yn ≡ y(xn, wMAP). Maximizing this evidence function with respect to α
again leads to the re-estimation equation given by (5.178).

The use of the evidence procedure to determine α is illustrated in Figure 5.22

for the synthetic two-dimensional data discussed in Appendix A.

Finally, we need the predictive distribution, which is deﬁned by (5.168). Again,
this integration is intractable due to the nonlinearity of the network function. The

simplest approximation is to assume that the posterior distribution is very narrow
and hence make the approximation

p(t|x,D) (cid:7) p(t|x, wMAP).

(5.185)

We can improve on this, however, by taking account of the variance of the posterior
distribution. In this case, a linear approximation for the network outputs, as was used
in the case of regression, would be inappropriate due to the logistic sigmoid output-
unit activation function that constrains the output to lie in the range (0, 1). Instead,
we make a linear approximation for the output unit activation in the form

a(x, w) (cid:7) aMAP(x) + bT(w − wMAP)

(5.186)
where aMAP(x) = a(x, wMAP), and the vector b ≡ ∇a(x, wMAP) can be found by
backpropagation.

(cid:6)

(cid:10)

Because we now have a Gaussian approximation for the posterior distribution
over w, and a model for a that is a linear function of w, we can now appeal to the
results of Section 4.5.2. The distribution of output unit activation values, induced by
the distribution over network weights, is given by

p(a|x,D) =

a − aMAP(x) − bT(x)(w − wMAP)

q(w|D) dw (5.187)
where q(w|D) is the Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution given by
(5.167). From Section 4.5.2, we see that this distribution is Gaussian with mean
aMAP ≡ a(x, wMAP), and variance

(cid:11)

a(x) = bT(x)A−1b(x).

Finally, to obtain the predictive distribution, we must marginalize over a using

Figure 5.23 An illustration of the Laplace approximation for a Bayesian neural network having 8 hidden units
with ‘tanh’ activation functions and a single logistic-sigmoid output unit. The weight parameters were found using
scaled conjugate gradients, and the hyperparameter α was optimized using the evidence framework. On the left
is the result of using the simple approximation (5.185) based on a point estimate wMAP of the parameters,
in which the green curve shows the y = 0.5 decision boundary, and the other contours correspond to output
probabilities of y = 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, and 0.9. On the right is the corresponding result obtained using (5.190). Note
that the effect of marginalization is to spread out the contours and to make the predictions less conﬁdent, so
that at each input point x, the posterior probabilities are shifted towards 0.5, while the y = 0.5 contour itself is
unaffected.

The convolution of a Gaussian with a logistic sigmoid is intractable. We therefore
apply the approximation (4.153) to (5.189) giving

Kernel
Methods

In Chapters 3 and 4, we considered linear parametric models for regression and
classiﬁcation in which the form of the mapping y(x, w) from input x to output y
is governed by a vector w of adaptive parameters. During the learning phase, a
set of training data is used either to obtain a point estimate of the parameter vector
or to determine a posterior distribution over this vector. The training data is then
discarded, and predictions for new inputs are based purely on the learned parameter
vector w. This approach is also used in nonlinear parametric models such as neural
networks.

However, there is a class of pattern recognition techniques, in which the training
data points, or a subset of them, are kept and used also during the prediction phase.
For instance, the Parzen probability density model comprised a linear combination
of ‘kernel’ functions each one centred on one of the training data points. Similarly,
in Section 2.5.2 we introduced a simple technique for classiﬁcation called nearest
neighbours, which involved assigning to each new test vector the same label as the

closest example from the training set. These are examples of memory-based methods
that involve storing the entire training set in order to make predictions for future data
points. They typically require a metric to be deﬁned that measures the similarity of
any two vectors in input space, and are generally fast to ‘train’ but slow at making
predictions for test data points.

Many linear parametric models can be re-cast into an equivalent ‘dual represen-
tation’ in which the predictions are also based on linear combinations of a kernel
function evaluated at the training data points. As we shall see, for models which are
based on a ﬁxed nonlinear feature space mapping φ(x), the kernel function is given
by the relation

k(x, x(cid:4)) = φ(x)Tφ(x(cid:4)).

(6.1)

From this deﬁnition, we see that the kernel is a symmetric function of its arguments
so that k(x, x(cid:4)) = k(x(cid:4)
, x). The kernel concept was introduced into the ﬁeld of pat-
tern recognition by Aizerman et al. (1964) in the context of the method of potential
functions, so-called because of an analogy with electrostatics. Although neglected
for many years, it was re-introduced into machine learning in the context of large-
margin classiﬁers by Boser et al.
(1992) giving rise to the technique of support
vector machines. Since then, there has been considerable interest in this topic, both
in terms of theory and applications. One of the most signiﬁcant developments has
been the extension of kernels to handle symbolic objects, thereby greatly expanding
the range of problems that can be addressed.
The simplest example of a kernel function is obtained by considering the identity
mapping for the feature space in (6.1) so that φ(x) = x, in which case k(x, x(cid:4)) =
xTx(cid:4)

. We shall refer to this as the linear kernel.
The concept of a kernel formulated as an inner product in a feature space allows
us to build interesting extensions of many well-known algorithms by making use of
the kernel trick, also known as kernel substitution. The general idea is that, if we have
an algorithm formulated in such a way that the input vector x enters only in the form
of scalar products, then we can replace that scalar product with some other choice of
kernel. For instance, the technique of kernel substitution can be applied to principal
component analysis in order to develop a nonlinear variant of PCA (Sch¨olkopf et al.,
1998). Other examples of kernel substitution include nearest-neighbour classiﬁers
and the kernel Fisher discriminant (Mika et al., 1999; Roth and Steinhage, 2000;
Baudat and Anouar, 2000).

There are numerous forms of kernel functions in common use, and we shall en-
counter several examples in this chapter. Many have the property of being a function
only of the difference between the arguments, so that k(x, x(cid:4)) = k(x − x(cid:4)), which
are known as stationary kernels because they are invariant to translations in input
space. A further specialization involves homogeneous kernels, also known as ra-
dial basis functions, which depend only on the magnitude of the distance (typically
Euclidean) between the arguments so that k(x, x(cid:4)) = k((cid:5)x − x(cid:4)(cid:5)).

For recent textbooks on kernel methods, see Sch¨olkopf and Smola (2002), Her-

brich (2002), and Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004).

Many linear models for regression and classiﬁcation can be reformulated in terms of
a dual representation in which the kernel function arises naturally. This concept will
play an important role when we consider support vector machines in the next chapter.
Here we consider a linear regression model whose parameters are determined by
minimizing a regularized sum-of-squares error function given by

J(w) =

1
2

wTφ(xn) − tn

wTw

(6.2)

where λ (cid:2) 0. If we set the gradient of J(w) with respect to w equal to zero, we see
that the solution for w takes the form of a linear combination of the vectors φ(xn),
with coefﬁcients that are functions of w, of the form

w = − 1

φ(xn) =

where Φ is the design matrix, whose nth row is given by φ(xn)T. Here the vector
a = (a1, . . . , aN )T, and we have deﬁned

an = − 1
λ

wTφ(xn) − tn

.

(6.4)

Instead of working with the parameter vector w, we can now reformulate the least-
squares algorithm in terms of the parameter vector a, giving rise to a dual represen-
tation. If we substitute w = ΦTa into J(w), we obtain

J(a) =

aTΦΦTa

(6.5)

where t = (t1, . . . , tN )T. We now deﬁne the Gram matrix K = ΦΦT, which is an
N × N symmetric matrix with elements

Knm = φ(xn)Tφ(xm) = k(xn, xm)

(6.6)
where we have introduced the kernel function k(x, x(cid:4)) deﬁned by (6.1). In terms of
the Gram matrix, the sum-of-squares error function can be written as

J(a) =

aTKKa − aTKt +

Setting the gradient of J(a) with respect to a to zero, we obtain the following solu-
tion

a = (K + λIN)

6. KERNEL METHODS

If we substitute this back into the linear regression model, we obtain the following
prediction for a new input x

y(x) = wTφ(x) = aTΦφ(x) = k(x)T (K + λIN)

−1 t

(6.9)

where we have deﬁned the vector k(x) with elements kn(x) = k(xn, x). Thus we
see that the dual formulation allows the solution to the least-squares problem to be
expressed entirely in terms of the kernel function k(x, x(cid:4)). This is known as a dual
formulation because, by noting that the solution for a can be expressed as a linear
combination of the elements of φ(x), we recover the original formulation in terms of
the parameter vector w. Note that the prediction at x is given by a linear combination
of the target values from the training set. In fact, we have already obtained this result,
using a slightly different notation, in Section 3.3.3.
In the dual formulation, we determine the parameter vector a by inverting an
N × N matrix, whereas in the original parameter space formulation we had to invert
an M × M matrix in order to determine w. Because N is typically much larger
than M, the dual formulation does not seem to be particularly useful. However, the
advantage of the dual formulation, as we shall see, is that it is expressed entirely in
terms of the kernel function k(x, x(cid:4)). We can therefore work directly in terms of
kernels and avoid the explicit introduction of the feature vector φ(x), which allows
us implicitly to use feature spaces of high, even inﬁnite, dimensionality.

The existence of a dual representation based on the Gram matrix is a property of
many linear models, including the perceptron. In Section 6.4, we will develop a dual-
ity between probabilistic linear models for regression and the technique of Gaussian
processes. Duality will also play an important role when we discuss support vector
machines in Chapter 7.

6.2. Constructing Kernels

In order to exploit kernel substitution, we need to be able to construct valid kernel
functions. One approach is to choose a feature space mapping φ(x) and then use
this to ﬁnd the corresponding kernel, as is illustrated in Figure 6.1. Here the kernel
function is deﬁned for a one-dimensional input space by

M(cid:2)

(cid:10)

(cid:11)2

k(x, x

(cid:4)) = φ(x)Tφ(x

(cid:4)) =

(cid:4))
φi(x)φi(x

(6.10)

where φi(x) are the basis functions.

i=1

An alternative approach is to construct kernel functions directly. In this case,
we must ensure that the function we choose is a valid kernel, in other words that it
corresponds to a scalar product in some (perhaps inﬁnite dimensional) feature space.
As a simple example, consider a kernel function given by

k(x, z) =

xTz

.

More generally, however, we need a simple way to test whether a function con-
stitutes a valid kernel without having to construct the function φ(x) explicitly. A
necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a function k(x, x(cid:4)) to be a valid kernel (Shawe-
Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) is that the Gram matrix K, whose elements are given by
k(xn, xm), should be positive semideﬁnite for all possible choices of the set {xn}.
Note that a positive semideﬁnite matrix is not the same thing as a matrix whose
elements are nonnegative.

One powerful technique for constructing new kernels is to build them out of
simpler kernels as building blocks. This can be done using the following properties:

Given valid kernels k1(x, x(cid:4)) and k2(x, x(cid:4)), the following new kernels will also
be valid:

k(x, x(cid:4)) = f(x)k1(x, x(cid:4))f(x(cid:4))
k(x, x(cid:4)) = q (k1(x, x(cid:4)))
k(x, x(cid:4)) = exp (k1(x, x(cid:4)))
k(x, x(cid:4)) = k1(x, x(cid:4)) + k2(x, x(cid:4))
k(x, x(cid:4)) = k1(x, x(cid:4))k2(x, x(cid:4))
k(x, x(cid:4)) = k3 (φ(x), φ(x(cid:4)))
k(x, x(cid:4)) = xTAx(cid:4)
k(x, x(cid:4)) = ka(xa, x(cid:4)

Equipped with these properties, we can now embark on the construction of more
complex kernels appropriate to speciﬁc applications. We require that the kernel
k(x, x(cid:4)) be symmetric and positive semideﬁnite and that it expresses the appropriate
form of similarity between x and x(cid:4)
according to the intended application. Here we
consider a few common examples of kernel functions. For a more extensive discus-
sion of ‘kernel engineering’, see Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004).

We saw that the simple polynomial kernel k(x, x(cid:4)) =

contains only
If we consider the slightly generalized kernel k(x, x(cid:4)) =
with c > 0, then the corresponding feature mapping φ(x) contains con-

terms of degree two.
xTx(cid:4) + c
stant and linear terms as well as terms of order two. Similarly, k(x, x(cid:4)) =
contains all monomials of order M. For instance, if x and x(cid:4)
are two images, then
the kernel represents a particular weighted sum of all possible products of M pixels
in the ﬁrst image with M pixels in the second image. This can similarly be gener-
alized to include all terms up to degree M by considering k(x, x(cid:4)) =
with c > 0. Using the results (6.17) and (6.18) for combining kernels we see that
these will all be valid kernel functions.

(6.26)

An important contribution to arise from the kernel viewpoint has been the exten-
sion to inputs that are symbolic, rather than simply vectors of real numbers. Kernel
functions can be deﬁned over objects as diverse as graphs, sets, strings, and text doc-
uments. Consider, for instance, a ﬁxed set and deﬁne a nonvectorial space consisting
of all possible subsets of this set. If A1 and A2 are two such subsets then one simple
choice of kernel would be

k(A1, A2) = 2|A1∩A2|

(6.27)
where A1 ∩ A2 denotes the intersection of sets A1 and A2, and |A| denotes the
number of subsets in A. This is a valid kernel function because it can be shown to
correspond to an inner product in a feature space.

One powerful approach to the construction of kernels starts from a probabilistic
generative model (Haussler, 1999), which allows us to apply generative models in a
discriminative setting. Generative models can deal naturally with missing data and
in the case of hidden Markov models can handle sequences of varying length. By
contrast, discriminative models generally give better performance on discriminative
tasks than generative models. It is therefore of some interest to combine these two
approaches (Lasserre et al., 2006). One way to combine them is to use a generative
model to deﬁne a kernel, and then use this kernel in a discriminative approach.

Given a generative model p(x) we can deﬁne a kernel by

k(x, x(cid:4)) = p(x)p(x(cid:4)).

(6.28)

This is clearly a valid kernel function because we can interpret it as an inner product
in the one-dimensional feature space deﬁned by the mapping p(x). It says that two
inputs x and x(cid:4)
are similar if they both have high probabilities. We can use (6.13) and
(6.17) to extend this class of kernels by considering sums over products of different
probability distributions, with positive weighting coefﬁcients p(i), of the form

k(x, x(cid:4)) =

p(x|i)p(x(cid:4)|i)p(i).

(cid:2)

6. KERNEL METHODS

Section 9.2

Section 13.2

Exercise 6.13

This is equivalent, up to an overall multiplicative constant, to a mixture distribution
in which the components factorize, with the index i playing the role of a ‘latent’
variable. Two inputs x and x(cid:4)
will give a large value for the kernel function, and
hence appear similar, if they have signiﬁcant probability under a range of different
components. Taking the limit of an inﬁnite sum, we can also consider kernels of the
form

(cid:6)

k(x, x(cid:4)) =

p(x|z)p(x(cid:4)|z)p(z) dz

(6.30)

where z is a continuous latent variable.
Now suppose that our data consists of ordered sequences of length L so that
an observation is given by X = {x1, . . . , xL}. A popular generative model for
sequences is the hidden Markov model, which expresses the distribution p(X) as a
marginalization over a corresponding sequence of hidden states Z = {z1, . . . , zL}.
We can use this approach to deﬁne a kernel function measuring the similarity of two
sequences X and X(cid:4)

by extending the mixture representation (6.29) to give
k(X, X(cid:4)) =

p(X|Z)p(X(cid:4)|Z)p(Z)

(cid:2)

(6.31)

Z

so that both observed sequences are generated by the same hidden sequence Z. This
model can easily be extended to allow sequences of differing length to be compared.
An alternative technique for using generative models to deﬁne kernel functions
is known as the Fisher kernel (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1999). Consider a parametric
generative model p(x|θ) where θ denotes the vector of parameters. The goal is to
ﬁnd a kernel that measures the similarity of two input vectors x and x(cid:4)
induced by the
generative model. Jaakkola and Haussler (1999) consider the gradient with respect
to θ, which deﬁnes a vector in a ‘feature’ space having the same dimensionality as
θ. In particular, they consider the Fisher score

g(θ, x) = ∇θ ln p(x|θ)

from which the Fisher kernel is deﬁned by

k(x, x(cid:4)) = g(θ, x)TF−1g(θ, x(cid:4)).

Here F is the Fisher information matrix, given by

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

(6.32)

(6.33)

F = Ex

g(θ, x)g(θ, x)T

(6.34)
where the expectation is with respect to x under the distribution p(x|θ). This can
be motivated from the perspective of information geometry (Amari, 1998), which
considers the differential geometry of the space of model parameters. Here we sim-
ply note that the presence of the Fisher information matrix causes this kernel to be
invariant under a nonlinear re-parameterization of the density model θ → ψ(θ).

In practice, it is often infeasible to evaluate the Fisher information matrix. One
approach is simply to replace the expectation in the deﬁnition of the Fisher informa-
tion with the sample average, giving

g(θ, xn)g(θ, xn)T.

Section 12.1.3

This is the covariance matrix of the Fisher scores, and so the Fisher kernel corre-
sponds to a whitening of these scores. More simply, we can just omit the Fisher
information matrix altogether and use the noninvariant kernel

k(x, x(cid:4)) = g(θ, x)Tg(θ, x(cid:4)).

(6.36)

An application of Fisher kernels to document retrieval is given by Hofmann (2000).

A ﬁnal example of a kernel function is the sigmoidal kernel given by

k(x, x(cid:4)) = tanh

axTx(cid:4) + b

(6.37)

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

whose Gram matrix in general is not positive semideﬁnite. This form of kernel
has, however, been used in practice (Vapnik, 1995), possibly because it gives kernel
expansions such as the support vector machine a superﬁcial resemblance to neural
network models. As we shall see, in the limit of an inﬁnite number of basis functions,
a Bayesian neural network with an appropriate prior reduces to a Gaussian process,
thereby providing a deeper link between neural networks and kernel methods.

Section 6.4.7

6.3. Radial Basis Function Networks

In Chapter 3, we discussed regression models based on linear combinations of ﬁxed
basis functions, although we did not discuss in detail what form those basis functions
might take. One choice that has been widely used is that of radial basis functions,
which have the property that each basis function depends only on the radial distance
(typically Euclidean) from a centre µj, so that φj(x) = h((cid:5)x − µj(cid:5)).
Historically, radial basis functions were introduced for the purpose of exact func-
tion interpolation (Powell, 1987). Given a set of input vectors {x1, . . . , xN} along
with corresponding target values {t1, . . . , tN}, the goal is to ﬁnd a smooth function
f(x) that ﬁts every target value exactly, so that f(xn) = tn for n = 1, . . . , N. This
is achieved by expressing f(x) as a linear combination of radial basis functions, one
centred on every data point

f(x) =

wnh((cid:5)x − xn(cid:5)).

(6.38)

n=1

The values of the coefﬁcients {wn} are found by least squares, and because there
are the same number of coefﬁcients as there are constraints, the result is a function
that ﬁts every target value exactly. In pattern recognition applications, however, the
target values are generally noisy, and exact interpolation is undesirable because this
corresponds to an over-ﬁtted solution.

Expansions in radial basis functions also arise from regularization theory (Pog-
gio and Girosi, 1990; Bishop, 1995a). For a sum-of-squares error function with a
regularizer deﬁned in terms of a differential operator, the optimal solution is given
by an expansion in the Green’s functions of the operator (which are analogous to the
eigenvectors of a discrete matrix), again with one basis function centred on each data

N(cid:2)

300

6. KERNEL METHODS

point. If the differential operator is isotropic then the Green’s functions depend only
on the radial distance from the corresponding data point. Due to the presence of the
regularizer, the solution no longer interpolates the training data exactly.

Another motivation for radial basis functions comes from a consideration of
the interpolation problem when the input (rather than the target) variables are noisy
If the noise on the input variable x is described
(Webb, 1994; Bishop, 1995a).
by a variable ξ having a distribution ν(ξ), then the sum-of-squares error function

We see that there is one basis function centred on every data point. This is known as
the Nadaraya-Watson model and will be derived again from a different perspective
in Section 6.3.1. If the noise distribution ν(ξ) is isotropic, so that it is a function
only of (cid:5)ξ(cid:5), then the basis functions will be radial.
n h(x − xn) = 1
for any value of x. The effect of such normalization is shown in Figure 6.2. Normal-
ization is sometimes used in practice as it avoids having regions of input space where
all of the basis functions take small values, which would necessarily lead to predic-
tions in such regions that are either small or controlled purely by the bias parameter.

Note that the basis functions (6.41) are normalized, so that

(cid:5)

Another situation in which expansions in normalized radial basis functions arise
is in the application of kernel density estimation to the problem of regression, as we
shall discuss in Section 6.3.1.

Because there is one basis function associated with every data point, the corre-
sponding model can be computationally costly to evaluate when making predictions
for new data points. Models have therefore been proposed (Broomhead and Lowe,
1988; Moody and Darken, 1989; Poggio and Girosi, 1990), which retain the expan-
sion in radial basis functions but where the number M of basis functions is smaller
than the number N of data points. Typically, the number of basis functions, and the
locations µi of their centres, are determined based on the input data {xn} alone. The
basis functions are then kept ﬁxed and the coefﬁcients {wi} are determined by least
squares by solving the usual set of linear equations, as discussed in Section 3.1.1.

basis functions on the right.

One of the simplest ways of choosing basis function centres is to use a randomly
chosen subset of the data points. A more systematic approach is called orthogonal
least squares (Chen et al., 1991). This is a sequential selection process in which at
each step the next data point to be chosen as a basis function centre corresponds to
the one that gives the greatest reduction in the sum-of-squares error. Values for the
expansion coefﬁcients are determined as part of the algorithm. Clustering algorithms
such as K-means have also been used, which give a set of basis function centres that
no longer coincide with training data points.

6.3.1 Nadaraya-Watson model
In Section 3.3.3, we saw that the prediction of a linear regression model for a
new input x takes the form of a linear combination of the training set target values
with coefﬁcients given by the ‘equivalent kernel’ (3.62) where the equivalent kernel
satisﬁes the summation constraint (3.64).
We can motivate the kernel regression model (3.61) from a different perspective,
starting with kernel density estimation. Suppose we have a training set {xn, tn} and
we use a Parzen density estimator to model the joint distribution p(x, t), so that

y(x), corresponding to the conditional average of the target variable conditioned on

The result (6.45) is known as the Nadaraya-Watson model, or kernel regression
(Nadaraya, 1964; Watson, 1964). For a localized kernel function, it has the prop-
erty of giving more weight to the data points xn that are close to x. Note that the

from which other expectations can be evaluated.

As an illustration we consider the case of a single input variable x in which
f(x, t) is given by a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian over the variable z = (x, t) with
variance σ2. The corresponding conditional distribution (6.48) is given by a Gaus-
sian mixture, and is shown, together with the conditional mean, for the sinusoidal
synthetic data set in Figure 6.3.

An obvious extension of this model is to allow for more ﬂexible forms of Gaus-
sian components, for instance having different variance parameters for the input and
target variables. More generally, we could model the joint distribution p(t, x) using
a Gaussian mixture model, trained using techniques discussed in Chapter 9 (Ghahra-
mani and Jordan, 1994), and then ﬁnd the corresponding conditional distribution
p(t|x). In this latter case we no longer have a representation in terms of kernel func-
tions evaluated at the training set data points. However, the number of components
in the mixture model can be smaller than the number of training set points, resulting
in a model that is faster to evaluate for test data points. We have thereby accepted an
increased computational cost during the training phase in order to have a model that
is faster at making predictions.

In Section 6.1, we introduced kernels by applying the concept of duality to a non-
probabilistic model for regression. Here we extend the role of kernels to probabilis-

304

6. KERNEL METHODS

tic discriminative models, leading to the framework of Gaussian processes. We shall
thereby see how kernels arise naturally in a Bayesian setting.

In Chapter 3, we considered linear regression models of the form y(x, w) =
wTφ(x) in which w is a vector of parameters and φ(x) is a vector of ﬁxed nonlinear
basis functions that depend on the input vector x. We showed that a prior distribution
over w induced a corresponding prior distribution over functions y(x, w). Given a
training data set, we then evaluated the posterior distribution over w and thereby
obtained the corresponding posterior distribution over regression functions, which
in turn (with the addition of noise) implies a predictive distribution p(t|x) for new
input vectors x.

In the Gaussian process viewpoint, we dispense with the parametric model and
instead deﬁne a prior probability distribution over functions directly. At ﬁrst sight, it
might seem difﬁcult to work with a distribution over the uncountably inﬁnite space of
functions. However, as we shall see, for a ﬁnite training set we only need to consider
the values of the function at the discrete set of input values xn corresponding to the
training set and test set data points, and so in practice we can work in a ﬁnite space.
Models equivalent to Gaussian processes have been widely studied in many dif-
ferent ﬁelds. For instance, in the geostatistics literature Gaussian process regression
is known as kriging (Cressie, 1993). Similarly, ARMA (autoregressive moving aver-
age) models, Kalman ﬁlters, and radial basis function networks can all be viewed as
forms of Gaussian process models. Reviews of Gaussian processes from a machine
learning perspective can be found in MacKay (1998), Williams (1999), and MacKay
(2003), and a comparison of Gaussian process models with alternative approaches is
given in Rasmussen (1996). See also Rasmussen and Williams (2006) for a recent
textbook on Gaussian processes.

6.4.1 Linear regression revisited
In order to motivate the Gaussian process viewpoint, let us return to the linear
regression example and re-derive the predictive distribution by working in terms
of distributions over functions y(x, w). This will provide a speciﬁc example of a
Gaussian process.

Consider a model deﬁned in terms of a linear combination of M ﬁxed basis

functions given by the elements of the vector φ(x) so that

y(x) = wTφ(x)

(6.49)

where x is the input vector and w is the M-dimensional weight vector. Now consider
a prior distribution over w given by an isotropic Gaussian of the form

p(w) = N (w|0, α

−1I)

(6.50)

governed by the hyperparameter α, which represents the precision (inverse variance)
of the distribution. For any given value of w, the deﬁnition (6.49) deﬁnes a partic-
ular function of x. The probability distribution over w deﬁned by (6.50) therefore
induces a probability distribution over functions y(x). In practice, we wish to eval-
uate this function at speciﬁc values of x, for example at the training data points

6.4. Gaussian Processes

x1, . . . , xN . We are therefore interested in the joint distribution of the function val-
ues y(x1), . . . , y(xN ), which we denote by the vector y with elements yn = y(xn)
for n = 1, . . . , N. From (6.49), this vector is given by

y = Φw

(6.51)
where Φ is the design matrix with elements Φnk = φk(xn). We can ﬁnd the proba-
bility distribution of y as follows. First of all we note that y is a linear combination of
Gaussian distributed variables given by the elements of w and hence is itself Gaus-
sian. We therefore need only to ﬁnd its mean and covariance, which are given from
(6.50) by

E[y] = ΦE[w] = 0

This model provides us with a particular example of a Gaussian process. In gen-
eral, a Gaussian process is deﬁned as a probability distribution over functions y(x)
such that the set of values of y(x) evaluated at an arbitrary set of points x1, . . . , xN
jointly have a Gaussian distribution. In cases where the input vector x is two di-
mensional, this may also be known as a Gaussian random ﬁeld. More generally, a
stochastic process y(x) is speciﬁed by giving the joint probability distribution for
any ﬁnite set of values y(x1), . . . , y(xN ) in a consistent manner.

A key point about Gaussian stochastic processes is that the joint distribution
over N variables y1, . . . , yN is speciﬁed completely by the second-order statistics,
namely the mean and the covariance. In most applications, we will not have any
prior knowledge about the mean of y(x) and so by symmetry we take it to be zero.
This is equivalent to choosing the mean of the prior over weight values p(w|α) to
be zero in the basis function viewpoint. The speciﬁcation of the Gaussian process is
then completed by giving the covariance of y(x) evaluated at any two values of x,
which is given by the kernel function

E [y(xn)y(xm)] = k(xn, xm).

(6.55)

For the speciﬁc case of a Gaussian process deﬁned by the linear regression model
(6.49) with a weight prior (6.50), the kernel function is given by (6.54).

We can also deﬁne the kernel function directly, rather than indirectly through a
choice of basis function. Figure 6.4 shows samples of functions drawn from Gaus-
sian processes for two different choices of kernel function. The ﬁrst of these is a
‘Gaussian’ kernel of the form (6.23), and the second is the exponential kernel given
by

(6.56)
which corresponds to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process originally introduced by Uh-
lenbeck and Ornstein (1930) to describe Brownian motion.

6.4.2 Gaussian processes for regression
In order to apply Gaussian process models to the problem of regression, we need

to take account of the noise on the observed target values, which are given by

tn = yn + n

(6.57)

where yn = y(xn), and n is a random noise variable whose value is chosen inde-
pendently for each observation n. Here we shall consider noise processes that have
a Gaussian distribution, so that

p(tn|yn) = N (tn|yn, β

−1)

(6.58)

where β is a hyperparameter representing the precision of the noise. Because the
noise is independent for each data point, the joint distribution of the target values
t = (t1, . . . , tN)T conditioned on the values of y = (y1, . . . , yN)T is given by an
isotropic Gaussian of the form

p(t|y) = N (t|y, β

−1IN )

(6.59)
where IN denotes the N × N unit matrix. From the deﬁnition of a Gaussian process,
the marginal distribution p(y) is given by a Gaussian whose mean is zero and whose
covariance is deﬁned by a Gram matrix K so that

p(y) = N (y|0, K).

(6.60)

The kernel function that determines K is typically chosen to express the property
that, for points xn and xm that are similar, the corresponding values y(xn) and
y(xm) will be more strongly correlated than for dissimilar points. Here the notion
of similarity will depend on the application.

In order to ﬁnd the marginal distribution p(t), conditioned on the input values
x1, . . . , xN , we need to integrate over y. This can be done by making use of the
results from Section 2.3.3 for the linear-Gaussian model. Using (2.115), we see that
the marginal distribution of t is given by

(cid:6)

p(t) =

p(t|y)p(y) dy = N (t|0, C)

(6.61)

6.4. Gaussian Processes

307

where the covariance matrix C has elements

C(xn, xm) = k(xn, xm) + β

−1δnm.

(6.62)

This result reﬂects the fact that the two Gaussian sources of randomness, namely
that associated with y(x) and that associated with , are independent and so their
covariances simply add.

One widely used kernel function for Gaussian process regression is given by the
exponential of a quadratic form, with the addition of constant and linear terms to
give

(cid:13)

Note that the term involving θ3 corresponds to a parametric model that is a linear
function of the input variables. Samples from this prior are plotted for various values
of the parameters θ0, . . . , θ3 in Figure 6.5, and Figure 6.6 shows a set of points sam-
pled from the joint distribution (6.60) along with the corresponding values deﬁned
by (6.61).

So far, we have used the Gaussian process viewpoint to build a model of the
joint distribution over sets of data points. Our goal in regression, however, is to
make predictions of the target variables for new inputs, given a set of training data.
Let us suppose that tN = (t1, . . . , tN)T, corresponding to input values x1, . . . , xN ,
comprise the observed training set, and our goal is to predict the target variable tN +1
for a new input vector xN +1. This requires that we evaluate the predictive distri-
bution p(tN +1|tN ). Note that this distribution is conditioned also on the variables
x1, . . . , xN and xN +1. However, to keep the notation simple we will not show these
conditioning variables explicitly.
To ﬁnd the conditional distribution p(tN +1|t), we begin by writing down the
joint distribution p(tN +1), where tN +1 denotes the vector (t1, . . . , tN , tN +1)T. We
then apply the results from Section 2.3.1 to obtain the required conditional distribu-
tion, as illustrated in Figure 6.7.

From (6.61), the joint distribution over t1, . . . , tN +1 will be given by

p(tN +1) = N (tN +1|0, CN +1)

(6.64)
where CN +1 is an (N + 1) × (N + 1) covariance matrix with elements given by
(6.62). Because this joint distribution is Gaussian, we can apply the results from
Section 2.3.1 to ﬁnd the conditional Gaussian distribution. To do this, we partition
the covariance matrix as follows

(cid:15)

(cid:16)

CN +1 =

(6.65)
where CN is the N × N covariance matrix with elements given by (6.62) for n, m =
1, . . . , N, the vector k has elements k(xn, xN +1) for n = 1, . . . , N, and the scalar

given by

These are the key results that deﬁne Gaussian process regression. Because the vector
k is a function of the test point input value xN +1, we see that the predictive distribu-
tion is a Gaussian whose mean and variance both depend on xN +1. An example of
Gaussian process regression is shown in Figure 6.8.

The only restriction on the kernel function is that the covariance matrix given by
(6.62) must be positive deﬁnite. If λi is an eigenvalue of K, then the corresponding
−1. It is therefore sufﬁcient that the kernel matrix
eigenvalue of C will be λi + β
k(xn, xm) be positive semideﬁnite for any pair of points xn and xm, so that λi (cid:2) 0,
because any eigenvalue λi that is zero will still give rise to a positive eigenvalue
for C because β > 0. This is the same restriction on the kernel function discussed
earlier, and so we can again exploit all of the techniques in Section 6.2 to construct

where an is the nth component of C
depends only on the distance (cid:5)xn − xm(cid:5), then we obtain an expansion in radial
basis functions.

The results (6.66) and (6.67) deﬁne the predictive distribution for Gaussian pro-
cess regression with an arbitrary kernel function k(xn, xm). In the particular case in
which the kernel function k(x, x(cid:4)) is deﬁned in terms of a ﬁnite set of basis functions,
we can derive the results obtained previously in Section 3.3.2 for linear regression
starting from the Gaussian process viewpoint.

For such models, we can therefore obtain the predictive distribution either by
taking a parameter space viewpoint and using the linear regression result or by taking
a function space viewpoint and using the Gaussian process result.
The central computational operation in using Gaussian processes will involve
the inversion of a matrix of size N × N, for which standard methods require O(N 3)
computations. By contrast, in the basis function model we have to invert a matrix
SN of size M × M, which has O(M 3) computational complexity. Note that for
both viewpoints, the matrix inversion must be performed once for the given training
set. For each new test point, both methods require a vector-matrix multiply, which
has cost O(N 2) in the Gaussian process case and O(M 2) for the linear basis func-
tion model. If the number M of basis functions is smaller than the number N of
data points, it will be computationally more efﬁcient to work in the basis function

framework. However, an advantage of a Gaussian processes viewpoint is that we
can consider covariance functions that can only be expressed in terms of an inﬁnite
number of basis functions.

For large training data sets, however, the direct application of Gaussian process
methods can become infeasible, and so a range of approximation schemes have been
developed that have better scaling with training set size than the exact approach
(Gibbs, 1997; Tresp, 2001; Smola and Bartlett, 2001; Williams and Seeger, 2001;
Csat´o and Opper, 2002; Seeger et al., 2003). Practical issues in the application of
Gaussian processes are discussed in Bishop and Nabney (2008).

We have introduced Gaussian process regression for the case of a single tar-
get variable. The extension of this formalism to multiple target variables, known
as co-kriging (Cressie, 1993), is straightforward. Various other extensions of Gaus-

sian process regression have also been considered, for purposes such as modelling
the distribution over low-dimensional manifolds for unsupervised learning (Bishop
et al., 1998a) and the solution of stochastic differential equations (Graepel, 2003).

6.4.3 Learning the hyperparameters
The predictions of a Gaussian process model will depend, in part, on the choice
of covariance function. In practice, rather than ﬁxing the covariance function, we
may prefer to use a parametric family of functions and then infer the parameter
values from the data. These parameters govern such things as the length scale of the
correlations and the precision of the noise and correspond to the hyperparameters in
a standard parametric model.
Techniques for learning the hyperparameters are based on the evaluation of the
likelihood function p(t|θ) where θ denotes the hyperparameters of the Gaussian pro-
cess model. The simplest approach is to make a point estimate of θ by maximizing
the log likelihood function. Because θ represents a set of hyperparameters for the
regression problem, this can be viewed as analogous to the type 2 maximum like-
lihood procedure for linear regression models. Maximization of the log likelihood
can be done using efﬁcient gradient-based optimization algorithms such as conjugate
gradients (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008).

The log likelihood function for a Gaussian process regression model is easily

evaluated using the standard form for a multivariate Gaussian distribution, giving

For nonlinear optimization, we also need the gradient of the log likelihood func-
tion with respect to the parameter vector θ. We shall assume that evaluation of the
derivatives of CN is straightforward, as would be the case for the covariance func-
tions considered in this chapter. Making use of the result (C.21) for the derivative of
N , together with the result (C.22) for the derivative of ln|CN|, we obtain

It is straightforward to introduce a prior over θ and to maximize the log poste-
rior using gradient-based methods. In a fully Bayesian treatment, we need to evaluate
marginals over θ weighted by the product of the prior p(θ) and the likelihood func-
tion p(t|θ). In general, however, exact marginalization will be intractable, and we
must resort to approximations.

The Gaussian process regression model gives a predictive distribution whose
mean and variance are functions of the input vector x. However, we have assumed
that the contribution to the predictive variance arising from the additive noise, gov-
erned by the parameter β, is a constant. For some problems, known as heteroscedas-
tic, the noise variance itself will also depend on x. To model this, we can extend the

Gaussian process framework by introducing a second Gaussian process to represent
the dependence of β on the input x (Goldberg et al., 1998). Because β is a variance,
and hence nonnegative, we use the Gaussian process to model ln β(x).

6.4.4 Automatic relevance determination
In the previous section, we saw how maximum likelihood could be used to de-
termine a value for the correlation length-scale parameter in a Gaussian process.
This technique can usefully be extended by incorporating a separate parameter for
each input variable (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). The result, as we shall see, is
that the optimization of these parameters by maximum likelihood allows the relative
importance of different inputs to be inferred from the data. This represents an exam-
ple in the Gaussian process context of automatic relevance determination, or ARD,
which was originally formulated in the framework of neural networks (MacKay,
1994; Neal, 1996). The mechanism by which appropriate inputs are preferred is
discussed in Section 7.2.2.

Consider a Gaussian process with a two-dimensional input space x = (x1, x2),

having a kernel function of the form

k(x, x(cid:4)) = θ0 exp

Samples from the resulting prior over functions y(x) are shown for two different
settings of the precision parameters ηi in Figure 6.9. We see that, as a particu-
lar parameter ηi becomes small, the function becomes relatively insensitive to the
corresponding input variable xi. By adapting these parameters to a data set using
maximum likelihood, it becomes possible to detect input variables that have little
effect on the predictive distribution, because the corresponding values of ηi will be
small. This can be useful in practice because it allows such inputs to be discarded.
ARD is illustrated using a simple synthetic data set having three inputs x1, x2 and x3
(Nabney, 2002) in Figure 6.10. The target variable t, is generated by sampling 100
values of x1 from a Gaussian, evaluating the function sin(2πx1), and then adding

Gaussian noise. Values of x2 are given by copying the corresponding values of x1
and adding noise, and values of x3 are sampled from an independent Gaussian dis-
tribution. Thus x1 is a good predictor of t, x2 is a more noisy predictor of t, and x3
has only chance correlations with t. The marginal likelihood for a Gaussian process
with ARD parameters η1, η2, η3 is optimized using the scaled conjugate gradients
algorithm. We see from Figure 6.10 that η1 converges to a relatively large value, η2
converges to a much smaller value, and η3 becomes very small indicating that x3 is
irrelevant for predicting t.

The ARD framework is easily incorporated into the exponential-quadratic kernel
(6.63) to give the following form of kernel function, which has been found useful for
applications of Gaussian processes to a range of regression problems

probabilities of the target variable for a new input vector, given a set of training
data. These probabilities must lie in the interval (0, 1), whereas a Gaussian process
model makes predictions that lie on the entire real axis. However, we can easily
adapt Gaussian processes to classiﬁcation problems by transforming the output of
the Gaussian process using an appropriate nonlinear activation function.
Consider ﬁrst the two-class problem with a target variable t ∈ {0, 1}. If we de-
ﬁne a Gaussian process over a function a(x) and then transform the function using
a logistic sigmoid y = σ(a), given by (4.59), then we will obtain a non-Gaussian
stochastic process over functions y(x) where y ∈ (0, 1). This is illustrated for the
case of a one-dimensional input space in Figure 6.11 in which the probability distri-

shows the result of transforming this sample using a logistic sigmoid function.

bution over the target variable t is then given by the Bernoulli distribution

p(t|a) = σ(a)t(1 − σ(a))1−t.

(6.73)

As usual, we denote the training set inputs by x1, . . . , xN with corresponding
observed target variables t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. We also consider a single test point
xN +1 with target value tN +1. Our goal is to determine the predictive distribution
p(tN +1|t), where we have left the conditioning on the input variables implicit. To do
this we introduce a Gaussian process prior over the vector aN +1, which has compo-
nents a(x1), . . . , a(xN +1). This in turn deﬁnes a non-Gaussian process over tN +1,
and by conditioning on the training data tN we obtain the required predictive distri-
bution. The Gaussian process prior for aN +1 takes the form
p(aN +1) = N (aN +1|0, CN +1).

(6.74)

Unlike the regression case, the covariance matrix no longer includes a noise term
because we assume that all of the training data points are correctly labelled. How-
ever, for numerical reasons it is convenient to introduce a noise-like term governed
by a parameter ν that ensures that the covariance matrix is positive deﬁnite. Thus
the covariance matrix CN +1 has elements given by

C(xn, xm) = k(xn, xm) + νδnm

(6.75)

where k(xn, xm) is any positive semideﬁnite kernel function of the kind considered
in Section 6.2, and the value of ν is typically ﬁxed in advance. We shall assume that
the kernel function k(x, x(cid:4)) is governed by a vector θ of parameters, and we shall
later discuss how θ may be learned from the training data.
For two-class problems, it is sufﬁcient to predict p(tN +1 = 1|tN ) because the
value of p(tN +1 = 0|tN ) is then given by 1 − p(tN +1 = 1|tN ). The required

6.4. Gaussian Processes

315

predictive distribution is given by

(cid:6)

p(tN +1 = 1|tN) =

p(tN +1 = 1|aN +1)p(aN +1|tN) daN +1

(6.76)

where p(tN +1 = 1|aN +1) = σ(aN +1).

This integral is analytically intractable, and so may be approximated using sam-
pling methods (Neal, 1997). Alternatively, we can consider techniques based on
an analytical approximation. In Section 4.5.2, we derived the approximate formula
(4.153) for the convolution of a logistic sigmoid with a Gaussian distribution. We
can use this result to evaluate the integral in (6.76) provided we have a Gaussian
approximation to the posterior distribution p(aN +1|tN ). The usual justiﬁcation for a
Gaussian approximation to a posterior distribution is that the true posterior will tend
to a Gaussian as the number of data points increases as a consequence of the central
limit theorem. In the case of Gaussian processes, the number of variables grows with
the number of data points, and so this argument does not apply directly. However, if
we consider increasing the number of data points falling in a ﬁxed region of x space,
then the corresponding uncertainty in the function a(x) will decrease, again leading
asymptotically to a Gaussian (Williams and Barber, 1998).

Three different approaches to obtaining a Gaussian approximation have been
considered. One technique is based on variational inference (Gibbs and MacKay,
2000) and makes use of the local variational bound (10.144) on the logistic sigmoid.
This allows the product of sigmoid functions to be approximated by a product of
Gaussians thereby allowing the marginalization over aN to be performed analyti-
cally. The approach also yields a lower bound on the likelihood function p(tN|θ).
The variational framework for Gaussian process classiﬁcation can also be extended
to multiclass (K > 2) problems by using a Gaussian approximation to the softmax
function (Gibbs, 1997).

A second approach uses expectation propagation (Opper and Winther, 2000b;
Minka, 2001b; Seeger, 2003). Because the true posterior distribution is unimodal, as
we shall see shortly, the expectation propagation approach can give good results.

6.4.6 Laplace approximation
The third approach to Gaussian process classiﬁcation is based on the Laplace
approximation, which we now consider in detail. In order to evaluate the predictive
distribution (6.76), we seek a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution
over aN +1, which, using Bayes’ theorem, is given by

6. KERNEL METHODS

where we have used p(tN|aN +1, aN) = p(tN|aN). The conditional distribution
p(aN +1|aN) is obtained by invoking the results (6.66) and (6.67) for Gaussian pro-
cess regression, to give

p(aN +1|aN ) = N (aN +1|kTC

N k).

(6.78)

We can therefore evaluate the integral in (6.77) by ﬁnding a Laplace approximation
for the posterior distribution p(aN|tN ), and then using the standard result for the
convolution of two Gaussian distributions.

The prior p(aN) is given by a zero-mean Gaussian process with covariance ma-

trix CN , and the data term (assuming independence of the data points) is given by

p(tN|aN ) =

σ(an)tn(1 − σ(an))1−tn =

eantnσ(−an).

First we need to ﬁnd the mode of the posterior distribution, and this requires that we
evaluate the gradient of Ψ(aN ), which is given by

∇Ψ(aN) = tN − σN − C

−1
N aN

(6.81)

where σN is a vector with elements σ(an). We cannot simply ﬁnd the mode by
setting this gradient to zero, because σN depends nonlinearly on aN , and so we
resort to an iterative scheme based on the Newton-Raphson method, which gives rise
to an iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm. This requires the second
derivatives of Ψ(aN ), which we also require for the Laplace approximation anyway,
and which are given by

∇∇Ψ(aN) = −WN − C

−1
N

(6.82)
where WN is a diagonal matrix with elements σ(an)(1− σ(an)), and we have used
the result (4.88) for the derivative of the logistic sigmoid function. Note that these
diagonal elements lie in the range (0, 1/4), and hence WN is a positive deﬁnite
matrix. Because CN (and hence its inverse) is positive deﬁnite by construction, and
because the sum of two positive deﬁnite matrices is also positive deﬁnite, we see
that the Hessian matrix A = −∇∇Ψ(aN) is positive deﬁnite and so the posterior
distribution p(aN|tN) is log convex and therefore has a single mode that is the global

is a function of aN .

(6.83)

These equations are iterated until they converge to the mode which we denote by
N . At the mode, the gradient ∇Ψ(aN) will vanish, and hence a(cid:1)
a(cid:1)

N will satisfy

N = CN (tN − σN).
a(cid:1)

Once we have found the mode a(cid:1)

N of the posterior, we can evaluate the Hessian

matrix given by

H = −∇∇Ψ(aN) = WN + C

N

(6.85)

where the elements of WN are evaluated using a(cid:1)
proximation to the posterior distribution p(aN|tN ) given by

N . This deﬁnes our Gaussian ap-

q(aN) = N (aN|a(cid:1)

N , H−1).

(6.86)

Exercise 6.26

We can now combine this with (6.78) and hence evaluate the integral (6.77). Because
this corresponds to a linear-Gaussian model, we can use the general result (2.115) to
give

E[aN +1|tN ] = kT(tN − σN )
var[aN +1|tN ] = c − kT(W
−1
N + CN )−1k.

(6.87)
(6.88)
Now that we have a Gaussian distribution for p(aN +1|tN ), we can approximate
the integral (6.76) using the result (4.153). As with the Bayesian logistic regression
model of Section 4.5, if we are only interested in the decision boundary correspond-
ing to p(tN +1|tN ) = 0.5, then we need only consider the mean and we can ignore
the effect of the variance.
We also need to determine the parameters θ of the covariance function. One
approach is to maximize the likelihood function given by p(tN|θ) for which we need
expressions for the log likelihood and its gradient. If desired, suitable regularization
terms can also be added, leading to a penalized maximum likelihood solution. The
likelihood function is deﬁned by
p(tN|θ) =

p(tN|aN )p(aN|θ) daN .

(6.89)

(cid:6)

This integral is analytically intractable, so again we make use of the Laplace approx-
imation. Using the result (4.135), we obtain the following approximation for the log
of the likelihood function

of ln p(tN|θ) with respect to the parameter vector θ. Note that changes in θ will
cause changes in a(cid:1)

differentiate (6.90) with respect to θ, we obtain two sets of terms, the ﬁrst arising
from the dependence of the covariance matrix CN on θ, and the rest arising from
dependence of a(cid:1)

N on θ.

The terms arising from the explicit dependence on θ can be found by using

Combining (6.91), (6.92), and (6.94), we can evaluate the gradient of the log
likelihood function, which can be used with standard nonlinear optimization algo-
rithms in order to determine a value for θ.

We can illustrate the application of the Laplace approximation for Gaussian pro-
cesses using the synthetic two-class data set shown in Figure 6.12. Extension of the
Laplace approximation to Gaussian processes involving K > 2 classes, using the
softmax activation function, is straightforward (Williams and Barber, 1998).

6.4.7 Connection to neural networks
We have seen that the range of functions which can be represented by a neural
network is governed by the number M of hidden units, and that, for sufﬁciently
large M, a two-layer network can approximate any given function with arbitrary
accuracy.
In the framework of maximum likelihood, the number of hidden units
needs to be limited (to a level dependent on the size of the training set) in order
to avoid over-ﬁtting. However, from a Bayesian perspective it makes little sense to
limit the number of parameters in the network according to the size of the training
set.

In a Bayesian neural network, the prior distribution over the parameter vector
w, in conjunction with the network function f(x, w), produces a prior distribution
over functions from y(x) where y is the vector of network outputs. Neal (1996)
has shown that, for a broad class of prior distributions over w, the distribution of
functions generated by a neural network will tend to a Gaussian process in the limit
M → ∞. It should be noted, however, that in this limit the output variables of the
neural network become independent. One of the great merits of neural networks is
that the outputs share the hidden units and so they can ‘borrow statistical strength’
from each other, that is, the weights associated with each hidden unit are inﬂuenced
by all of the output variables not just by one of them. This property is therefore lost
in the Gaussian process limit.

We have seen that a Gaussian process is determined by its covariance (kernel)
function. Williams (1998) has given explicit forms for the covariance in the case of
two speciﬁc choices for the hidden unit activation function (probit and Gaussian).
These kernel functions k(x, x(cid:4)) are nonstationary, i.e. they cannot be expressed as
a function of the difference x − x(cid:4)
, as a consequence of the Gaussian weight prior
being centred on zero which breaks translation invariance in weight space.

6. KERNEL METHODS

Exercises

By working directly with the covariance function we have implicitly marginal-
ized over the distribution of weights. If the weight prior is governed by hyperpa-
rameters, then their values will determine the length scales of the distribution over
functions, as can be understood by studying the examples in Figure 5.11 for the case
of a ﬁnite number of hidden units. Note that we cannot marginalize out the hyperpa-
rameters analytically, and must instead resort to techniques of the kind discussed in
Section 6.4.

expressing this rule in terms of scalar products and then making use of kernel sub-
stitution, formulate the nearest-neighbour classiﬁer for a general nonlinear kernel.

Sparse Kernel

Machines

In the previous chapter, we explored a variety of learning algorithms based on non-
linear kernels. One of the signiﬁcant limitations of many such algorithms is that
the kernel function k(xn, xm) must be evaluated for all possible pairs xn and xm
of training points, which can be computationally infeasible during training and can
lead to excessive computation times when making predictions for new data points.
In this chapter we shall look at kernel-based algorithms that have sparse solutions,
so that predictions for new inputs depend only on the kernel function evaluated at a
subset of the training data points.

We begin by looking in some detail at the support vector machine (SVM), which
became popular in some years ago for solving problems in classiﬁcation, regression,
and novelty detection. An important property of support vector machines is that the
determination of the model parameters corresponds to a convex optimization prob-
lem, and so any local solution is also a global optimum. Because the discussion of
support vector machines makes extensive use of Lagrange multipliers, the reader is

encouraged to review the key concepts covered in Appendix E. Additional infor-
mation on support vector machines can be found in Vapnik (1995), Burges (1998),
Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor (2000), M¨uller et al. (2001), Sch¨olkopf and Smola
(2002), and Herbrich (2002).

The SVM is a decision machine and so does not provide posterior probabilities.
We have already discussed some of the beneﬁts of determining probabilities in Sec-
tion 1.5.4. An alternative sparse kernel technique, known as the relevance vector
machine (RVM), is based on a Bayesian formulation and provides posterior proba-
bilistic outputs, as well as having typically much sparser solutions than the SVM.

Section 7.2

7.1. Maximum Margin Classiﬁers

We begin our discussion of support vector machines by returning to the two-class
classiﬁcation problem using linear models of the form

y(x) = wTφ(x) + b

(7.1)
where φ(x) denotes a ﬁxed feature-space transformation, and we have made the
bias parameter b explicit. Note that we shall shortly introduce a dual representation
expressed in terms of kernel functions, which avoids having to work explicitly in
feature space. The training data set comprises N input vectors x1, . . . , xN , with
corresponding target values t1, . . . , tN where tn ∈ {−1, 1}, and new data points x
are classiﬁed according to the sign of y(x).

We shall assume for the moment that the training data set is linearly separable in
feature space, so that by deﬁnition there exists at least one choice of the parameters
w and b such that a function of the form (7.1) satisﬁes y(xn) > 0 for points having
tn = +1 and y(xn) < 0 for points having tn = −1, so that tny(xn) > 0 for all
training data points.

There may of course exist many such solutions that separate the classes exactly.
In Section 4.1.7, we described the perceptron algorithm that is guaranteed to ﬁnd
a solution in a ﬁnite number of steps. The solution that it ﬁnds, however, will be
dependent on the (arbitrary) initial values chosen for w and b as well as on the
order in which the data points are presented. If there are multiple solutions all of
which classify the training data set exactly, then we should try to ﬁnd the one that
will give the smallest generalization error. The support vector machine approaches
this problem through the concept of the margin, which is deﬁned to be the smallest
distance between the decision boundary and any of the samples, as illustrated in
Figure 7.1.

In support vector machines the decision boundary is chosen to be the one for
which the margin is maximized. The maximum margin solution can be motivated us-
ing computational learning theory, also known as statistical learning theory. How-
ever, a simple insight into the origins of maximum margin has been given by Tong
and Koller (2000) who consider a framework for classiﬁcation based on a hybrid of
generative and discriminative approaches. They ﬁrst model the distribution over in-
put vectors x for each class using a Parzen density estimator with Gaussian kernels

Figure 7.1 The margin is deﬁned as the perpendicular distance between the decision boundary and the closest
of the data points, as shown on the left ﬁgure. Maximizing the margin leads to a particular choice of decision
boundary, as shown on the right. The location of this boundary is determined by a subset of the data points,
known as support vectors, which are indicated by the circles.

having a common parameter σ2. Together with the class priors, this deﬁnes an opti-
mal misclassiﬁcation-rate decision boundary. However, instead of using this optimal
boundary, they determine the best hyperplane by minimizing the probability of error
relative to the learned density model. In the limit σ2 → 0, the optimal hyperplane
is shown to be the one having maximum margin. The intuition behind this result is
that as σ2 is reduced, the hyperplane is increasingly dominated by nearby data points
relative to more distant ones. In the limit, the hyperplane becomes independent of
data points that are not support vectors.

We shall see in Figure 10.13 that marginalization with respect to the prior distri-
bution of the parameters in a Bayesian approach for a simple linearly separable data
set leads to a decision boundary that lies in the middle of the region separating the
data points. The large margin solution has similar behaviour.
Recall from Figure 4.1 that the perpendicular distance of a point x from a hyper-
plane deﬁned by y(x) = 0 where y(x) takes the form (7.1) is given by |y(x)|/(cid:5)w(cid:5).
Furthermore, we are only interested in solutions for which all data points are cor-
rectly classiﬁed, so that tny(xn) > 0 for all n. Thus the distance of a point xn to the
decision surface is given by

tny(xn)

(cid:5)w(cid:5)

(cid:5)w(cid:5) = tn(wTφ(xn) + b)
(cid:12)

(cid:8)

(cid:10)

(cid:11)(cid:9)(cid:13)

.

(7.2)

The margin is given by the perpendicular distance to the closest point xn from the
data set, and we wish to optimize the parameters w and b in order to maximize this
distance. Thus the maximum margin solution is found by solving

arg max

(7.3)
where we have taken the factor 1/(cid:5)w(cid:5) outside the optimization over n because w

does not depend on n. Direct solution of this optimization problem would be very
complex, and so we shall convert it into an equivalent problem that is much easier
to solve. To do this we note that if we make the rescaling w → κw and b → κb,
then the distance from any point xn to the decision surface, given by tny(xn)/(cid:5)w(cid:5),
is unchanged. We can use this freedom to set

for the point that is closest to the surface. In this case, all data points will satisfy the
constraints

n = 1, . . . , N.

(7.5)
This is known as the canonical representation of the decision hyperplane.
In the
case of data points for which the equality holds, the constraints are said to be active,
whereas for the remainder they are said to be inactive. By deﬁnition, there will
always be at least one active constraint, because there will always be a closest point,
and once the margin has been maximized there will be at least two active constraints.
The optimization problem then simply requires that we maximize (cid:5)w(cid:5)−1, which is
equivalent to minimizing (cid:5)w(cid:5)2, and so we have to solve the optimization problem

subject to the constraints given by (7.5). The factor of 1/2 in (7.6) is included for
later convenience. This is an example of a quadratic programming problem in which
we are trying to minimize a quadratic function subject to a set of linear inequality
constraints. It appears that the bias parameter b has disappeared from the optimiza-
tion. However, it is determined implicitly via the constraints, because these require
that changes to (cid:5)w(cid:5) be compensated by changes to b. We shall see how this works
shortly.
In order to solve this constrained optimization problem, we introduce Lagrange
multipliers an (cid:2) 0, with one multiplier an for each of the constraints in (7.5), giving
the Lagrangian function

Here the kernel function is deﬁned by k(x, x(cid:4)) = φ(x)Tφ(x(cid:4)). Again, this takes the
form of a quadratic programming problem in which we optimize a quadratic function
of a subject to a set of inequality constraints. We shall discuss techniques for solving
such quadratic programming problems in Section 7.1.1.

The solution to a quadratic programming problem in M variables in general has
computational complexity that is O(M 3). In going to the dual formulation we have
turned the original optimization problem, which involved minimizing (7.6) over M
variables, into the dual problem (7.10), which has N variables. For a ﬁxed set of
basis functions whose number M is smaller than the number N of data points, the
move to the dual problem appears disadvantageous. However, it allows the model to
be reformulated using kernels, and so the maximum margin classiﬁer can be applied
efﬁciently to feature spaces whose dimensionality exceeds the number of data points,
including inﬁnite feature spaces. The kernel formulation also makes clear the role
of the constraint that the kernel function k(x, x(cid:4)) be positive deﬁnite, because this

ensures that the Lagrangian function(cid:4)L(a) is bounded below, giving rise to a well-

deﬁned optimization problem.
In order to classify new data points using the trained model, we evaluate the sign
of y(x) deﬁned by (7.1). This can be expressed in terms of the parameters {an} and
the kernel function by substituting for w using (7.8) to give

N(cid:2)

y(x) =

Joseph-Louis Lagrange
1736–1813

Although widely considered to be
a French mathematician, Lagrange
was born in Turin in Italy. By the age
of nineteen, he had already made
important contributions mathemat-
ics and had been appointed as Pro-
fessor at the Royal Artillery School in Turin. For many

years, Euler worked hard to persuade Lagrange to
move to Berlin, which he eventually did in 1766 where
he succeeded Euler as Director of Mathematics at
the Berlin Academy. Later he moved to Paris, nar-
rowly escaping with his life during the French revo-
lution thanks to the personal intervention of Lavoisier
(the French chemist who discovered oxygen) who him-
self was later executed at the guillotine. Lagrange
made key contributions to the calculus of variations
and the foundations of dynamics.

330

7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES

In Appendix E, we show that a constrained optimization of this form satisﬁes the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which in this case require that the following
three properties hold

an (cid:2) 0
tny(xn) − 1 (cid:2) 0
an {tny(xn) − 1} = 0.

(7.14)
(7.15)
(7.16)

Thus for every data point, either an = 0 or tny(xn) = 1. Any data point for
which an = 0 will not appear in the sum in (7.13) and hence plays no role in making
predictions for new data points. The remaining data points are called support vectors,
and because they satisfy tny(xn) = 1, they correspond to points that lie on the
maximum margin hyperplanes in feature space, as illustrated in Figure 7.1. This
property is central to the practical applicability of support vector machines. Once
the model is trained, a signiﬁcant proportion of the data points can be discarded and
only the support vectors retained.

Having solved the quadratic programming problem and found a value for a, we
can then determine the value of the threshold parameter b by noting that any support
vector xn satisﬁes tny(xn) = 1. Using (7.13) this gives

where S denotes the set of indices of the support vectors. Although we can solve

and then averaging these equations over all support vectors and solving for b to give

where NS is the total number of support vectors.

For later comparison with alternative models, we can express the maximum-
margin classiﬁer in terms of the minimization of an error function, with a simple
quadratic regularizer, in the form

E∞(y(xn)tn − 1) + λ(cid:5)w(cid:5)2

(7.19)

n=1

where E∞(z) is a function that is zero if z (cid:2) 0 and ∞ otherwise and ensures that
the constraints (7.5) are satisﬁed. Note that as long as the regularization parameter
satisﬁes λ > 0, its precise value plays no role.

Figure 7.2 shows an example of the classiﬁcation resulting from training a sup-
port vector machine on a simple synthetic data set using a Gaussian kernel of the

form (6.23). Although the data set is not linearly separable in the two-dimensional
data space x, it is linearly separable in the nonlinear feature space deﬁned implicitly
by the nonlinear kernel function. Thus the training data points are perfectly separated
in the original data space.

This example also provides a geometrical insight into the origin of sparsity in
the SVM. The maximum margin hyperplane is deﬁned by the location of the support
vectors. Other data points can be moved around freely (so long as they remain out-
side the margin region) without changing the decision boundary, and so the solution
will be independent of such data points.

7.1.1 Overlapping class distributions
So far, we have assumed that the training data points are linearly separable in the
feature space φ(x). The resulting support vector machine will give exact separation
of the training data in the original input space x, although the corresponding decision
boundary will be nonlinear. In practice, however, the class-conditional distributions
may overlap, in which case exact separation of the training data can lead to poor
generalization.

We therefore need a way to modify the support vector machine so as to allow
some of the training points to be misclassiﬁed. From (7.19) we see that in the case
of separable classes, we implicitly used an error function that gave inﬁnite error
if a data point was misclassiﬁed and zero error if it was classiﬁed correctly, and
then optimized the model parameters to maximize the margin. We now modify this
approach so that data points are allowed to be on the ‘wrong side’ of the margin
boundary, but with a penalty that increases with the distance from that boundary. For
the subsequent optimization problem, it is convenient to make this penalty a linear
function of this distance. To do this, we introduce slack variables, ξn (cid:2) 0 where
n = 1, . . . , N, with one slack variable for each training data point (Bennett, 1992;
Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). These are deﬁned by ξn = 0 for data points that are on or
inside the correct margin boundary and ξn = |tn − y(xn)| for other points. Thus a
data point that is on the decision boundary y(xn) = 0 will have ξn = 1, and points

with ξn > 1 will be misclassiﬁed. The exact classiﬁcation constraints (7.5) are then
replaced with

n = 1, . . . , N

(7.20)
in which the slack variables are constrained to satisfy ξn (cid:2) 0. Data points for which
ξn = 0 are correctly classiﬁed and are either on the margin or on the correct side
of the margin. Points for which 0 < ξn (cid:1) 1 lie inside the margin, but on the cor-
rect side of the decision boundary, and those data points for which ξn > 1 lie on
the wrong side of the decision boundary and are misclassiﬁed, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 7.3. This is sometimes described as relaxing the hard margin constraint to give a
soft margin and allows some of the training set data points to be misclassiﬁed. Note
that while slack variables allow for overlapping class distributions, this framework is
still sensitive to outliers because the penalty for misclassiﬁcation increases linearly
with ξ.

Our goal is now to maximize the margin while softly penalizing points that lie

on the wrong side of the margin boundary. We therefore minimize

where the parameter C > 0 controls the trade-off between the slack variable penalty
and the margin. Because any point that is misclassiﬁed has ξn > 1, it follows that
n ξn is an upper bound on the number of misclassiﬁed points. The parameter C is
therefore analogous to (the inverse of) a regularization coefﬁcient because it controls
the trade-off between minimizing training errors and controlling model complexity.
In the limit C → ∞, we will recover the earlier support vector machine for separable
data.

We can now interpret the resulting solution. As before, a subset of the data

which is identical to the separable case, except that the constraints are somewhat
different. To see what these constraints are, we note that an (cid:2) 0 is required because
these are Lagrange multipliers. Furthermore, (7.31) together with µn (cid:2) 0 implies
an (cid:1) C. We therefore have to minimize (7.32) with respect to the dual variables

model (7.13). The remaining data points constitute the support vectors. These have
an > 0 and hence from (7.25) must satisfy

tny(xn) = 1 − ξn.

(7.35)

If an < C, then (7.31) implies that µn > 0, which from (7.28) requires ξn = 0 and
hence such points lie on the margin. Points with an = C can lie inside the margin
and can either be correctly classiﬁed if ξn (cid:1) 1 or misclassiﬁed if ξn > 1.

To determine the parameter b in (7.1), we note that those support vectors for

This approach has the advantage that the parameter ν, which replaces C, can be
interpreted as both an upper bound on the fraction of margin errors (points for which
ξn > 0 and hence which lie on the wrong side of the margin boundary and which may
or may not be misclassiﬁed) and a lower bound on the fraction of support vectors. An
example of the ν-SVM applied to a synthetic data set is shown in Figure 7.4. Here
Gaussian kernels of the form exp (−γ(cid:5)x − x(cid:4)(cid:5)2) have been used, with γ = 0.45.

Although predictions for new inputs are made using only the support vectors,
the training phase (i.e., the determination of the parameters a and b) makes use of
the whole data set, and so it is important to have efﬁcient algorithms for solving

the quadratic programming problem. We ﬁrst note that the objective function(cid:4)L(a)

given by (7.10) or (7.32) is quadratic and so any local optimum will also be a global
optimum provided the constraints deﬁne a convex region (which they do as a conse-
quence of being linear). Direct solution of the quadratic programming problem us-
ing traditional techniques is often infeasible due to the demanding computation and
memory requirements, and so more practical approaches need to be found. The tech-
nique of chunking (Vapnik, 1982) exploits the fact that the value of the Lagrangian
is unchanged if we remove the rows and columns of the kernel matrix corresponding
to Lagrange multipliers that have value zero. This allows the full quadratic pro-
gramming problem to be broken down into a series of smaller ones, whose goal is
eventually to identify all of the nonzero Lagrange multipliers and discard the others.
Chunking can be implemented using protected conjugate gradients (Burges, 1998).
Although chunking reduces the size of the matrix in the quadratic function from the
number of data points squared to approximately the number of nonzero Lagrange
multipliers squared, even this may be too big to ﬁt in memory for large-scale appli-
cations. Decomposition methods (Osuna et al., 1996) also solve a series of smaller
quadratic programming problems but are designed so that each of these is of a ﬁxed
size, and so the technique can be applied to arbitrarily large data sets. However, it
still involves numerical solution of quadratic programming subproblems and these
can be problematic and expensive. One of the most popular approaches to training
support vector machines is called sequential minimal optimization, or SMO (Platt,
1999). It takes the concept of chunking to the extreme limit and considers just two
Lagrange multipliers at a time. In this case, the subproblem can be solved analyti-
cally, thereby avoiding numerical quadratic programming altogether. Heuristics are
given for choosing the pair of Lagrange multipliers to be considered at each step.
In practice, SMO is found to have a scaling with the number of data points that is
somewhere between linear and quadratic depending on the particular application.

We have seen that kernel functions correspond to inner products in feature spaces
that can have high, or even inﬁnite, dimensionality. By working directly in terms of
the kernel function, without introducing the feature space explicitly, it might there-
fore seem that support vector machines somehow manage to avoid the curse of di-

336

mensionality. This is not the case, however, because there are constraints amongst
the feature values that restrict the effective dimensionality of feature space. To see
this consider a simple second-order polynomial kernel that we can expand in terms
of its components

This kernel function therefore represents an inner product in a feature space having
six dimensions, in which the mapping from input space to feature space is described
by the vector function φ(x). However, the coefﬁcients weighting these different
features are constrained to have speciﬁc forms. Thus any set of points in the original
two-dimensional space x would be constrained to lie exactly on a two-dimensional
nonlinear manifold embedded in the six-dimensional feature space.

We have already highlighted the fact that the support vector machine does not
provide probabilistic outputs but instead makes classiﬁcation decisions for new in-
put vectors. Veropoulos et al. (1999) discuss modiﬁcations to the SVM to allow
the trade-off between false positive and false negative errors to be controlled. How-
ever, if we wish to use the SVM as a module in a larger probabilistic system, then
probabilistic predictions of the class label t for new inputs x are required.

To address this issue, Platt (2000) has proposed ﬁtting a logistic sigmoid to the
outputs of a previously trained support vector machine. Speciﬁcally, the required
conditional probability is assumed to be of the form

p(t = 1|x) = σ (Ay(x) + B)

(7.43)

where y(x) is deﬁned by (7.1). Values for the parameters A and B are found by
minimizing the cross-entropy error function deﬁned by a training set consisting of
pairs of values y(xn) and tn. The data used to ﬁt the sigmoid needs to be independent
of that used to train the original SVM in order to avoid severe over-ﬁtting. This two-
stage approach is equivalent to assuming that the output y(x) of the support vector
machine represents the log-odds of x belonging to class t = 1. Because the SVM
training procedure is not speciﬁcally intended to encourage this, the SVM can give
a poor approximation to the posterior probabilities (Tipping, 2001).

7.1.2 Relation to logistic regression
As with the separable case, we can re-cast the SVM for nonseparable distri-
butions in terms of the minimization of a regularized error function. This will also
allow us to highlight similarities, and differences, compared to the logistic regression
model.
We have seen that for data points that are on the correct side of the margin
boundary, and which therefore satisfy yntn (cid:2) 1, we have ξn = 0, and for the

remaining points we have ξn = 1 − yntn. Thus the objective function (7.21) can be
written (up to an overall multiplicative constant) in the form

N(cid:2)

ESV(yntn) + λ(cid:5)w(cid:5)2

(7.44)

n=1

where λ = (2C)−1, and ESV(·) is the hinge error function deﬁned by

ESV(yntn) = [1 − yntn]+

(7.45)
where [· ]+ denotes the positive part. The hinge error function, so-called because
of its shape, is plotted in Figure 7.5. It can be viewed as an approximation to the
misclassiﬁcation error, i.e., the error function that ideally we would like to minimize,
which is also shown in Figure 7.5.
When we considered the logistic regression model in Section 4.3.2, we found it
convenient to work with target variable t ∈ {0, 1}. For comparison with the support
vector machine, we ﬁrst reformulate maximum likelihood logistic regression using
the target variable t ∈ {−1, 1}. To do this, we note that p(t = 1|y) = σ(y) where
y(x) is given by (7.1), and σ(y) is the logistic sigmoid function deﬁned by (4.59). It
follows that p(t = −1|y) = 1 − σ(y) = σ(−y), where we have used the properties
of the logistic sigmoid function, and so we can write

p(t|y) = σ(yt).

(7.46)

Exercise 7.6

From this we can construct an error function by taking the negative logarithm of the
likelihood function that, with a quadratic regularizer, takes the form

N(cid:2)

ELR(yntn) + λ(cid:5)w(cid:5)2.

where

n=1

ELR(yt) = ln (1 + exp(−yt)) .

(7.47)

(7.48)

338

7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES

For comparison with other error functions, we can divide by ln(2) so that the error
function passes through the point (0, 1). This rescaled error function is also plotted
in Figure 7.5 and we see that it has a similar form to the support vector error function.
The key difference is that the ﬂat region in ESV(yt) leads to sparse solutions.

Both the logistic error and the hinge loss can be viewed as continuous approx-
imations to the misclassiﬁcation error. Another continuous error function that has
sometimes been used to solve classiﬁcation problems is the squared error, which
is again plotted in Figure 7.5. It has the property, however, of placing increasing
emphasis on data points that are correctly classiﬁed but that are a long way from
the decision boundary on the correct side. Such points will be strongly weighted at
the expense of misclassiﬁed points, and so if the objective is to minimize the mis-
classiﬁcation rate, then a monotonically decreasing error function would be a better
choice.

7.1.3 Multiclass SVMs
The support vector machine is fundamentally a two-class classiﬁer. In practice,
however, we often have to tackle problems involving K > 2 classes. Various meth-
ods have therefore been proposed for combining multiple two-class SVMs in order
to build a multiclass classiﬁer.
One commonly used approach (Vapnik, 1998) is to construct K separate SVMs,
in which the kth model yk(x) is trained using the data from class Ck as the positive
examples and the data from the remaining K − 1 classes as the negative examples.
This is known as the one-versus-the-rest approach. However, in Figure 4.2 we saw
that using the decisions of the individual classiﬁers can lead to inconsistent results
in which an input is assigned to multiple classes simultaneously. This problem is
sometimes addressed by making predictions for new inputs x using

y(x) = max

k

yk(x).

(7.49)

Unfortunately, this heuristic approach suffers from the problem that the different
classiﬁers were trained on different tasks, and there is no guarantee that the real-
valued quantities yk(x) for different classiﬁers will have appropriate scales.

Another problem with the one-versus-the-rest approach is that the training sets
are imbalanced. For instance, if we have ten classes each with equal numbers of
training data points, then the individual classiﬁers are trained on data sets comprising
90% negative examples and only 10% positive examples, and the symmetry of the
original problem is lost. A variant of the one-versus-the-rest scheme was proposed
by Lee et al. (2001) who modify the target values so that the positive class has target
+1 and the negative class has target −1/(K − 1).

Weston and Watkins (1999) deﬁne a single objective function for training all
K SVMs simultaneously, based on maximizing the margin from each to remaining
classes. However, this can result in much slower training because, instead of solving
K separate optimization problems each over N data points with an overall cost of
O(KN 2), a single optimization problem of size (K − 1)N must be solved giving an
overall cost of O(K 2N 2).

7.1. Maximum Margin Classiﬁers

339

Another approach is to train K(K −1)/2 different 2-class SVMs on all possible
pairs of classes, and then to classify test points according to which class has the high-
est number of ‘votes’, an approach that is sometimes called one-versus-one. Again,
we saw in Figure 4.2 that this can lead to ambiguities in the resulting classiﬁcation.
Also, for large K this approach requires signiﬁcantly more training time than the
one-versus-the-rest approach. Similarly, to evaluate test points, signiﬁcantly more
computation is required.

The latter problem can be alleviated by organizing the pairwise classiﬁers into
a directed acyclic graph (not to be confused with a probabilistic graphical model)
leading to the DAGSVM (Platt et al., 2000). For K classes, the DAGSVM has a total
of K(K − 1)/2 classiﬁers, and to classify a new test point only K − 1 pairwise
classiﬁers need to be evaluated, with the particular classiﬁers used depending on
which path through the graph is traversed.

A different approach to multiclass classiﬁcation, based on error-correcting out-
put codes, was developed by Dietterich and Bakiri (1995) and applied to support
vector machines by Allwein et al. (2000). This can be viewed as a generalization of
the voting scheme of the one-versus-one approach in which more general partitions
of the classes are used to train the individual classiﬁers. The K classes themselves
are represented as particular sets of responses from the two-class classiﬁers chosen,
and together with a suitable decoding scheme, this gives robustness to errors and to
ambiguity in the outputs of the individual classiﬁers. Although the application of
SVMs to multiclass classiﬁcation problems remains an open issue, in practice the
one-versus-the-rest approach is the most widely used in spite of its ad-hoc formula-
tion and its practical limitations.

There are also single-class support vector machines, which solve an unsuper-
vised learning problem related to probability density estimation. Instead of mod-
elling the density of data, however, these methods aim to ﬁnd a smooth boundary
enclosing a region of high density. The boundary is chosen to represent a quantile of
the density, that is, the probability that a data point drawn from the distribution will
land inside that region is given by a ﬁxed number between 0 and 1 that is speciﬁed in
advance. This is a more restricted problem than estimating the full density but may
be sufﬁcient in speciﬁc applications. Two approaches to this problem using support
vector machines have been proposed. The algorithm of Sch¨olkopf et al. (2001) tries
to ﬁnd a hyperplane that separates all but a ﬁxed fraction ν of the training data from
the origin while at the same time maximizing the distance (margin) of the hyperplane
from the origin, while Tax and Duin (1999) look for the smallest sphere in feature
space that contains all but a fraction ν of the data points. For kernels k(x, x(cid:4)) that
are functions only of x − x(cid:4)

, the two algorithms are equivalent.

7.1.4 SVMs for regression
We now extend support vector machines to regression problems while at the
same time preserving the property of sparseness. In simple linear regression, we

(7.50)

To obtain sparse solutions, the quadratic error function is replaced by an -insensitive
error function (Vapnik, 1995), which gives zero error if the absolute difference be-
tween the prediction y(x) and the target t is less than  where  > 0. A simple
example of an -insensitive error function, having a linear cost associated with errors
outside the insensitive region, is given by

E(y(x) − t) =

and is illustrated in Figure 7.6.

We therefore minimize a regularized error function given by

where y(x) is given by (7.1). By convention the (inverse) regularization parameter,
denoted C, appears in front of the error term.
As before, we can re-express the optimization problem by introducing slack
variables. For each data point xn, we now need two slack variables ξn (cid:2) 0 and
corresponds to a point for which tn < y(xn) − , as illustrated in Figure 7.7.

(cid:1)ξn (cid:2) 0, where ξn > 0 corresponds to a point for which tn > y(xn) + , and(cid:1)ξn > 0

The condition for a target point to lie inside the -tube is that yn −  (cid:1) tn (cid:1)
yn+, where yn = y(xn). Introducing the slack variables allows points to lie outside
the tube provided the slack variables are nonzero, and the corresponding conditions
are

tn (cid:1) y(xn) +  + ξn

tn (cid:2) y(xn) −  −(cid:1)ξn.

Substituting (7.57) into (7.1), we see that predictions for new inputs can be made

using

which is again expressed in terms of the kernel function.

The corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, which state that at
the solution the product of the dual variables and the constraints must vanish, are
given by

and such points must lie either on or below the lower boundary of the -tube.

From these we can obtain several useful results. First of all, we note that a coefﬁcient
an can only be nonzero if  + ξn + yn − tn = 0, which implies that the data point
either lies on the upper boundary of the -tube (ξn = 0) or lies above the upper

boundary (ξn > 0). Similarly, a nonzero value for(cid:1)an implies  +(cid:1)ξn − yn + tn = 0,
Furthermore, the two constraints  + ξn + yn − tn = 0 and  +(cid:1)ξn − yn + tn = 0
(cid:1)ξn are nonnegative while  is strictly positive, and so for every data point xn, either
an or(cid:1)an (or both) must be zero.

evaluated in the predictive model (7.64) are those that involve the support vectors.

The parameter b can be found by considering a data point for which 0 < an <
C, which from (7.67) must have ξn = 0, and from (7.65) must therefore satisfy
 + yn − tn = 0. Using (7.1) and solving for b, we obtain

for which 0 <(cid:1)an < C. In practice, it is better to average over all such estimates of

As with the classiﬁcation case, there is an alternative formulation of the SVM
for regression in which the parameter governing complexity has a more intuitive
interpretation (Sch¨olkopf et al., 2000). In particular, instead of ﬁxing the width  of
the insensitive region, we ﬁx instead a parameter ν that bounds the fraction of points
lying outside the tube. This involves maximizing

It can be shown that there are at most νN data points falling outside the insensitive
tube, while at least νN data points are support vectors and so lie either on the tube
or outside it.

The use of a support vector machine to solve a regression problem is illustrated
using the sinusoidal data set in Figure 7.8. Here the parameters ν and C have been
chosen by hand. In practice, their values would typically be determined by cross-
validation.

7.1.5 Computational learning theory
Historically, support vector machines have largely been motivated and analysed
using a theoretical framework known as computational learning theory, also some-
times called statistical learning theory (Anthony and Biggs, 1992; Kearns and Vazi-
rani, 1994; Vapnik, 1995; Vapnik, 1998). This has its origins with Valiant (1984)
who formulated the probably approximately correct, or PAC, learning framework.
The goal of the PAC framework is to understand how large a data set needs to be in
order to give good generalization. It also gives bounds for the computational cost of
learning, although we do not consider these here.
Suppose that a data set D of size N is drawn from some joint distribution p(x, t)
where x is the input variable and t represents the class label, and that we restrict
attention to ‘noise free’ situations in which the class labels are determined by some
(unknown) deterministic function t = g(x). In PAC learning we say that a function
f(x;D), drawn from a space F of such functions on the basis of the training set
D, has good generalization if its expected error rate is below some pre-speciﬁed
threshold , so that
(7.75)
where I(·) is the indicator function, and the expectation is with respect to the dis-
tribution p(x, t). The quantity on the left-hand side is a random variable, because
it depends on the training set D, and the PAC framework requires that (7.75) holds,
with probability greater than 1 − δ, for a data set D drawn randomly from p(x, t).
Here δ is another pre-speciﬁed parameter, and the terminology ‘probably approxi-
mately correct’ comes from the requirement that with high probability (greater than
1− δ), the error rate be small (less than ). For a given choice of model space F, and
for given parameters  and δ, PAC learning aims to provide bounds on the minimum
size N of data set needed to meet this criterion. A key quantity in PAC learning is
the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, or VC dimension, which provides a measure of
the complexity of a space of functions, and which allows the PAC framework to be
extended to spaces containing an inﬁnite number of functions.

Ex,t [I (f(x;D) (cid:9)= t)] < 

The bounds derived within the PAC framework are often described as worst-

7.2. Relevance Vector Machines

345

case, because they apply to any choice for the distribution p(x, t), so long as both
the training and the test examples are drawn (independently) from the same distribu-
tion, and for any choice for the function f(x) so long as it belongs to F. In real-world
applications of machine learning, we deal with distributions that have signiﬁcant reg-
ularity, for example in which large regions of input space carry the same class label.
As a consequence of the lack of any assumptions about the form of the distribution,
the PAC bounds are very conservative, in other words they strongly over-estimate
the size of data sets required to achieve a given generalization performance. For this
reason, PAC bounds have found few, if any, practical applications.
One attempt to improve the tightness of the PAC bounds is the PAC-Bayesian
framework (McAllester, 2003), which considers a distribution over the space F of
functions, somewhat analogous to the prior in a Bayesian treatment. This still con-
siders any possible choice for p(x, t), and so although the bounds are tighter, they
are still very conservative.

7.2. Relevance Vector Machines

Support vector machines have been used in a variety of classiﬁcation and regres-
sion applications. Nevertheless, they suffer from a number of limitations, several
of which have been highlighted already in this chapter. In particular, the outputs of
an SVM represent decisions rather than posterior probabilities. Also, the SVM was
originally formulated for two classes, and the extension to K > 2 classes is prob-
lematic. There is a complexity parameter C, or ν (as well as a parameter  in the case
of regression), that must be found using a hold-out method such as cross-validation.
Finally, predictions are expressed as linear combinations of kernel functions that are
centred on training data points and that are required to be positive deﬁnite.

The relevance vector machine or RVM (Tipping, 2001) is a Bayesian sparse ker-
nel technique for regression and classiﬁcation that shares many of the characteristics
of the SVM whilst avoiding its principal limitations. Additionally, it typically leads
to much sparser models resulting in correspondingly faster performance on test data
whilst maintaining comparable generalization error.

In contrast to the SVM we shall ﬁnd it more convenient to introduce the regres-

sion form of the RVM ﬁrst and then consider the extension to classiﬁcation tasks.

7.2.1 RVM for regression
The relevance vector machine for regression is a linear model of the form studied
in Chapter 3 but with a modiﬁed prior that results in sparse solutions. The model
deﬁnes a conditional distribution for a real-valued target variable t, given an input
vector x, which takes the form

p(t|x, w, β) = N (t|y(x), β

−2 is the noise precision (inverse noise variance), and the mean is given

y(x) =

wiφi(x) = wTφ(x)

(7.77)

i=1

with ﬁxed nonlinear basis functions φi(x), which will typically include a constant
term so that the corresponding weight parameter represents a ‘bias’.

The relevance vector machine is a speciﬁc instance of this model, which is in-
tended to mirror the structure of the support vector machine. In particular, the basis
functions are given by kernels, with one kernel associated with each of the data
points from the training set. The general expression (7.77) then takes the SVM-like
form

y(x) =

wnk(x, xn) + b

(7.78)

where b is a bias parameter. The number of parameters in this case is M = N + 1,
and y(x) has the same form as the predictive model (7.64) for the SVM, except that
the coefﬁcients an are here denoted wn. It should be emphasized that the subsequent
analysis is valid for arbitrary choices of basis function, and for generality we shall
work with the form (7.77). In contrast to the SVM, there is no restriction to positive-
deﬁnite kernels, nor are the basis functions tied in either number or location to the
training data points.

Suppose we are given a set of N observations of the input vector x, which we
n with n = 1, . . . , N. The
denote collectively by a data matrix X whose nth row is xT
corresponding target values are given by t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. Thus, the likelihood
function is given by

N(cid:14)

n=1

M(cid:14)

p(t|X, w, β) =

p(tn|xn, w, β

−1).

(7.79)

Next we introduce a prior distribution over the parameter vector w and as in
Chapter 3, we shall consider a zero-mean Gaussian prior. However, the key differ-
ence in the RVM is that we introduce a separate hyperparameter αi for each of the
weight parameters wi instead of a single shared hyperparameter. Thus the weight
prior takes the form

p(w|α) =

N (wi|0, α

−1
i )

(7.80)

i=1

where αi represents the precision of the corresponding parameter wi, and α denotes
(α1, . . . , αM )T. We shall see that, when we maximize the evidence with respect
to these hyperparameters, a signiﬁcant proportion of them go to inﬁnity, and the
corresponding weight parameters have posterior distributions that are concentrated
at zero. The basis functions associated with these parameters therefore play no role

7.2. Relevance Vector Machines

347

in the predictions made by the model and so are effectively pruned out, resulting in
a sparse model.

Using the result (3.49) for linear regression models, we see that the posterior

distribution for the weights is again Gaussian and takes the form

p(w|t, X, α, β) = N (w|m, Σ)

(7.81)

where Φ is the N × M design matrix with elements Φni = φi(xn), and A =

K is the symmetric (N + 1) × (N + 1) kernel matrix with elements k(xn, xm).

The values of α and β are determined using type-2 maximum likelihood, also

Our goal is now to maximize (7.85) with respect to the hyperparameters α and
β. This requires only a small modiﬁcation to the results obtained in Section 3.5 for
the evidence approximation in the linear regression model. Again, we can identify
two approaches. In the ﬁrst, we simply set the required derivatives of the marginal
likelihood to zero and obtain the following re-estimation equations

in which Σii is the ith diagonal component of the posterior covariance Σ given by

ating the mean and covariance of the posterior using (7.82) and (7.83), respectively,
and then alternately re-estimating the hyperparameters, using (7.87) and (7.88), and
re-estimating the posterior mean and covariance, using (7.82) and (7.83), until a suit-
able convergence criterion is satisﬁed.

Exercise 9.23

Section 7.2.2

Exercise 7.14

Section 6.4.2

The second approach is to use the EM algorithm, and is discussed in Sec-
tion 9.3.4. These two approaches to ﬁnding the values of the hyperparameters that
maximize the evidence are formally equivalent. Numerically, however, it is found
that the direct optimization approach corresponding to (7.87) and (7.88) gives some-
what faster convergence (Tipping, 2001).
As a result of the optimization, we ﬁnd that a proportion of the hyperparameters
{αi} are driven to large (in principle inﬁnite) values, and so the weight parameters
wi corresponding to these hyperparameters have posterior distributions with mean
and variance both zero. Thus those parameters, and the corresponding basis func-
tions φi(x), are removed from the model and play no role in making predictions for
new inputs. In the case of models of the form (7.78), the inputs xn corresponding to
the remaining nonzero weights are called relevance vectors, because they are iden-
tiﬁed through the mechanism of automatic relevance determination, and are analo-
gous to the support vectors of an SVM. It is worth emphasizing, however, that this
mechanism for achieving sparsity in probabilistic models through automatic rele-
vance determination is quite general and can be applied to any model expressed as
an adaptive linear combination of basis functions.

Having found values α(cid:1) and β(cid:1) for the hyperparameters that maximize the
marginal likelihood, we can evaluate the predictive distribution over t for a new
input x. Using (7.76) and (7.81), this is given by

p(t|x, X, t, α(cid:1), β(cid:1)) =

p(t|x, w, β(cid:1))p(w|X, t, α(cid:1), β(cid:1)) dw
t|mTφ(x), σ2(x)

.

(cid:6)
= N(cid:10)

(cid:11)

(7.90)

Thus the predictive mean is given by (7.76) with w set equal to the posterior mean
m, and the variance of the predictive distribution is given by
σ2(x) = (β(cid:1))−1 + φ(x)TΣφ(x)

(7.91)

where Σ is given by (7.83) in which α and β are set to their optimized values α(cid:1) and
β(cid:1). This is just the familiar result (3.59) obtained in the context of linear regression.
Recall that for localized basis functions, the predictive variance for linear regression
models becomes small in regions of input space where there are no basis functions.
In the case of an RVM with the basis functions centred on data points, the model will
therefore become increasingly certain of its predictions when extrapolating outside
the domain of the data (Rasmussen and Qui˜nonero-Candela, 2005), which of course
is undesirable. The predictive distribution in Gaussian process regression does not

suffer from this problem. However, the computational cost of making predictions
with a Gaussian processes is typically much higher than with an RVM.

Figure 7.9 shows an example of the RVM applied to the sinusoidal regression
data set. Here the noise precision parameter β is also determined through evidence
maximization. We see that the number of relevance vectors in the RVM is signif-
icantly smaller than the number of support vectors used by the SVM. For a wide
range of regression and classiﬁcation tasks, the RVM is found to give models that
are typically an order of magnitude more compact than the corresponding support
vector machine, resulting in a signiﬁcant improvement in the speed of processing on
test data. Remarkably, this greater sparsity is achieved with little or no reduction in
generalization error compared with the corresponding SVM.

The principal disadvantage of the RVM compared to the SVM is that training
involves optimizing a nonconvex function, and training times can be longer than for a
comparable SVM. For a model with M basis functions, the RVM requires inversion
of a matrix of size M × M, which in general requires O(M 3) computation. In the
speciﬁc case of the SVM-like model (7.78), we have M = N +1. As we have noted,
there are techniques for training SVMs whose cost is roughly quadratic in N. Of
course, in the case of the RVM we always have the option of starting with a smaller
number of basis functions than N + 1. More signiﬁcantly, in the relevance vector
machine the parameters governing complexity and noise variance are determined
automatically from a single training run, whereas in the support vector machine the
parameters C and  (or ν) are generally found using cross-validation, which involves
multiple training runs. Furthermore, in the next section we shall derive an alternative
procedure for training the relevance vector machine that improves training speed
signiﬁcantly.

7.2.2 Analysis of sparsity
We have noted earlier that the mechanism of automatic relevance determination
causes a subset of parameters to be driven to zero. We now examine in more detail

ϕ = (φ(x1), φ(x2))T, which is poorly aligned with the target data vector t. On the left we see a model having
only isotropic noise, so that C = β−1I, corresponding to α = ∞, with β set to its most probable value. On
the right we see the same model but with a ﬁnite value of α. In each case the red ellipse corresponds to unit
Mahalanobis distance, with |C| taking the same value for both plots, while the dashed green circle shows the
contrition arising from the noise term β−1. We see that any ﬁnite value of α reduces the probability of the

the mechanism of sparsity in the context of the relevance vector machine. In the
process, we will arrive at a signiﬁcantly faster procedure for optimizing the hyper-
parameters compared to the direct techniques given above.

Before proceeding with a mathematical analysis, we ﬁrst give some informal
insight into the origin of sparsity in Bayesian linear models. Consider a data set
comprising N = 2 observations t1 and t2, together with a model having a single
basis function φ(x), with hyperparameter α, along with isotropic noise having pre-
cision β. From (7.85), the marginal likelihood is given by p(t|α, β) = N (t|0, C) in
which the covariance matrix takes the form

C =

1
β

I +

1
α

ϕϕT

(7.92)

where ϕ denotes the N-dimensional vector (φ(x1), φ(x2))T, and similarly t =
(t1, t2)T. Notice that this is just a zero-mean Gaussian process model over t with
covariance C. Given a particular observation for t, our goal is to ﬁnd α(cid:1) and β(cid:1) by
maximizing the marginal likelihood. We see from Figure 7.10 that, if there is a poor
alignment between the direction of ϕ and that of the training data vector t, then the
corresponding hyperparameter α will be driven to ∞, and the basis vector will be
pruned from the model. This arises because any ﬁnite value for α will always assign
a lower probability to the data, thereby decreasing the value of the density at t, pro-
vided that β is set to its optimal value. We see that any ﬁnite value for α would cause
the distribution to be elongated in a direction away from the data, thereby increasing
the probability mass in regions away from the observed data and hence reducing the
value of the density at the target data vector itself. For the more general case of M

7.2. Relevance Vector Machines

351

basis vectors ϕ1, . . . , ϕM a similar intuition holds, namely that if a particular basis
vector is poorly aligned with the data vector t, then it is likely to be pruned from the
model.

We now investigate the mechanism for sparsity from a more mathematical per-
spective, for a general case involving M basis functions. To motivate this analysis
we ﬁrst note that, in the result (7.87) for re-estimating the parameter αi, the terms on
the right-hand side are themselves also functions of αi. These results therefore rep-
resent implicit solutions, and iteration would be required even to determine a single
αi with all other αj for j (cid:9)= i ﬁxed.

This suggests a different approach to solving the optimization problem for the
RVM, in which we make explicit all of the dependence of the marginal likelihood
(7.85) on a particular αi and then determine its stationary points explicitly (Faul and
Tipping, 2002; Tipping and Faul, 2003). To do this, we ﬁrst pull out the contribution
from αi in the matrix C deﬁned by (7.86) to give

where ϕi denotes the ith column of Φ, in other words the N-dimensional vector with
elements (φi(x1), . . . , φi(xN )), in contrast to φn, which denotes the nth row of Φ.
The matrix C−i represents the matrix C with the contribution from basis function i
removed. Using the matrix identities (C.7) and (C.15), the determinant and inverse
of C can then be written

(7.95)

Using these results, we can then write the log marginal likelihood function (7.85) in
the form

(7.96)
where L(α−i) is simply the log marginal likelihood with basis function ϕi omitted,
and the quantity λ(αi) is deﬁned by

is more likely to be pruned from the model. The ‘sparsity’ measures the extent to
which basis function ϕi overlaps with the other basis vectors in the model, and the
‘quality’ represents a measure of the alignment of the basis vector ϕn with the error
between the training set values t = (t1, . . . , tN)T and the vector y−i of predictions
that would result from the model with the vector ϕi excluded (Tipping and Faul,
2003).

Exercise 7.16

These two solutions are illustrated in Figure 7.11. We see that the relative size of
the quality and sparsity terms determines whether a particular basis vector will be
pruned from the model or not. A more complete analysis (Faul and Tipping, 2002),
based on the second derivatives of the marginal likelihood, conﬁrms these solutions
are indeed the unique maxima of λ(αi).

Note that this approach has yielded a closed-form solution for αi, for given
values of the other hyperparameters. As well as providing insight into the origin of
sparsity in the RVM, this analysis also leads to a practical algorithm for optimizing
the hyperparameters that has signiﬁcant speed advantages. This uses a ﬁxed set
of candidate basis vectors, and then cycles through them in turn to decide whether
each vector should be included in the model or not. The resulting sequential sparse
Bayesian learning algorithm is described below.

Sequential Sparse Bayesian Learning Algorithm

1. If solving a regression problem, initialize β.
2. Initialize using one basis function ϕ1, with hyperparameter α1 set using
(7.101), with the remaining hyperparameters αj for j (cid:9)= i initialized to

Note that if q2

In practice, it is convenient to evaluate the quantities

where Φ and Σ involve only those basis vectors that correspond to ﬁnite hyperpa-
rameters αi. At each stage the required computations therefore scale like O(M 3),
where M is the number of active basis vectors in the model and is typically much
smaller than the number N of training patterns.

7.2.3 RVM for classiﬁcation
We can extend the relevance vector machine framework to classiﬁcation prob-
lems by applying the ARD prior over weights to a probabilistic linear classiﬁcation
model of the kind studied in Chapter 4. To start with, we consider two-class prob-
lems with a binary target variable t ∈ {0, 1}. The model now takes the form of a
linear combination of basis functions transformed by a logistic sigmoid function

Exercise 7.17

7. SPARSE KERNEL MACHINES

Exercise 7.18

where σ(·) is the logistic sigmoid function deﬁned by (4.59).
If we introduce a
Gaussian prior over the weight vector w, then we obtain the model that has been
considered already in Chapter 4. The difference here is that in the RVM, this model
uses the ARD prior (7.80) in which there is a separate precision hyperparameter
associated with each weight parameter.

In contrast to the regression model, we can no longer integrate analytically over
the parameter vector w. Here we follow Tipping (2001) and use the Laplace ap-
proximation, which was applied to the closely related problem of Bayesian logistic
regression in Section 4.5.1.

We begin by initializing the hyperparameter vector α. For this given value of
α, we then build a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution and thereby
obtain an approximation to the marginal likelihood. Maximization of this approxi-
mate marginal likelihood then leads to a re-estimated value for α, and the process is
repeated until convergence.

Let us consider the Laplace approximation for this model in more detail. For
a ﬁxed value of α, the mode of the posterior distribution over w is obtained by
maximizing

ln p(w|t, α) = ln{p(t|w)p(w|α)} − ln p(t|α)

where A = diag(αi). This can be done using iterative reweighted least squares
(IRLS) as discussed in Section 4.3.3. For this, we need the gradient vector and
Hessian matrix of the log posterior distribution, which from (7.109) are given by

∇∇ ln p(w|t, α) = −(cid:10)

(cid:11)
∇ ln p(w|t, α) = ΦT(t − y) − Aw

(7.110)
(7.111)
where B is an N × N diagonal matrix with elements bn = yn(1 − yn), the vector
y = (y1, . . . , yN)T, and Φ is the design matrix with elements Φni = φi(xn). Here
we have used the property (4.88) for the derivative of the logistic sigmoid function.
At convergence of the IRLS algorithm, the negative Hessian represents the inverse
covariance matrix for the Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution.

The mode of the resulting approximation to the posterior distribution, corre-
sponding to the mean of the Gaussian approximation, is obtained setting (7.110) to
zero, giving the mean and covariance of the Laplace approximation in the form

Section 13.3

This takes the same form as (7.85) in the regression case, and so we can apply the
same analysis of sparsity and obtain the same fast learning algorithm in which we
fully optimize a single hyperparameter αi at each step.

Figure 7.12 shows the relevance vector machine applied to a synthetic classiﬁ-
cation data set. We see that the relevance vectors tend not to lie in the region of the
decision boundary, in contrast to the support vector machine. This is consistent with
our earlier discussion of sparsity in the RVM, because a basis function φi(x) centred
on a data point near the boundary will have a vector ϕi that is poorly aligned with
the training data vector t.

One of the potential advantages of the relevance vector machine compared with
the SVM is that it makes probabilistic predictions. For example, this allows the RVM
to be used to help construct an emission density in a nonlinear extension of the linear
dynamical system for tracking faces in video sequences (Williams et al., 2005).

So far, we have considered the RVM for binary classiﬁcation problems. For
K > 2 classes, we again make use of the probabilistic approach in Section 4.3.4 in
which there are K linear models of the form

where the target values tnk have a 1-of-K coding for each data point n, and T is a
matrix with elements tnk. Again, the Laplace approximation can be used to optimize
the hyperparameters (Tipping, 2001), in which the model and its Hessian are found
using IRLS. This gives a more principled approach to multiclass classiﬁcation than
the pairwise method used in the support vector machine and also provides probabilis-
tic predictions for new data points. The principal disadvantage is that the Hessian
matrix has size M K×M K, where M is the number of active basis functions, which
gives an additional factor of K 3 in the computational cost of training compared with
the two-class RVM.

The principal disadvantage of the relevance vector machine is the relatively long
training times compared with the SVM. This is offset, however, by the avoidance of
cross-validation runs to set the model complexity parameters. Furthermore, because
it yields sparser models, the computation time on test points, which is usually the
more important consideration in practice, is typically much less.

Graphical
Models

Probabilities play a central role in modern pattern recognition. We have seen in
Chapter 1 that probability theory can be expressed in terms of two simple equations
corresponding to the sum rule and the product rule. All of the probabilistic infer-
ence and learning manipulations discussed in this book, no matter how complex,
amount to repeated application of these two equations. We could therefore proceed
to formulate and solve complicated probabilistic models purely by algebraic ma-
nipulation. However, we shall ﬁnd it highly advantageous to augment the analysis
using diagrammatic representations of probability distributions, called probabilistic
graphical models. These offer several useful properties:

1. They provide a simple way to visualize the structure of a probabilistic model

and can be used to design and motivate new models.

2. Insights into the properties of the model, including conditional independence

properties, can be obtained by inspection of the graph.

359

360

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

3. Complex computations, required to perform inference and learning in sophis-
ticated models, can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations, in which
underlying mathematical expressions are carried along implicitly.

A graph comprises nodes (also called vertices) connected by links (also known
as edges or arcs). In a probabilistic graphical model, each node represents a random
variable (or group of random variables), and the links express probabilistic relation-
ships between these variables. The graph then captures the way in which the joint
distribution over all of the random variables can be decomposed into a product of
factors each depending only on a subset of the variables. We shall begin by dis-
cussing Bayesian networks, also known as directed graphical models, in which the
links of the graphs have a particular directionality indicated by arrows. The other
major class of graphical models are Markov random ﬁelds, also known as undirected
graphical models, in which the links do not carry arrows and have no directional
signiﬁcance. Directed graphs are useful for expressing causal relationships between
random variables, whereas undirected graphs are better suited to expressing soft con-
straints between random variables. For the purposes of solving inference problems,
it is often convenient to convert both directed and undirected graphs into a different
representation called a factor graph.

In this chapter, we shall focus on the key aspects of graphical models as needed
for applications in pattern recognition and machine learning. More general treat-
ments of graphical models can be found in the books by Whittaker (1990), Lauritzen
(1996), Jensen (1996), Castillo et al. (1997), Jordan (1999), Cowell et al. (1999),
and Jordan (2007).

8.1. Bayesian Networks

In order to motivate the use of directed graphs to describe probability distributions,
consider ﬁrst an arbitrary joint distribution p(a, b, c) over three variables a, b, and c.
Note that at this stage, we do not need to specify anything further about these vari-
ables, such as whether they are discrete or continuous. Indeed, one of the powerful
aspects of graphical models is that a speciﬁc graph can make probabilistic statements
for a broad class of distributions. By application of the product rule of probability
(1.11), we can write the joint distribution in the form

p(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(a, b).

(8.1)

A second application of the product rule, this time to the second term on the right-
hand side of (8.1), gives

p(a, b, c) = p(c|a, b)p(b|a)p(a).

(8.2)

Note that this decomposition holds for any choice of the joint distribution. We now
represent the right-hand side of (8.2) in terms of a simple graphical model as follows.
First we introduce a node for each of the random variables a, b, and c and associate
each node with the corresponding conditional distribution on the right-hand side of

Figure 8.1 A directed graphical model representing the joint probabil-
ity distribution over three variables a, b, and c, correspond-
ing to the decomposition on the right-hand side of (8.2).

a

b

8.1. Bayesian Networks

361

c

(8.2). Then, for each conditional distribution we add directed links (arrows) to the
graph from the nodes corresponding to the variables on which the distribution is
conditioned. Thus for the factor p(c|a, b), there will be links from nodes a and b to
node c, whereas for the factor p(a) there will be no incoming links. The result is the
graph shown in Figure 8.1. If there is a link going from a node a to a node b, then we
say that node a is the parent of node b, and we say that node b is the child of node a.
Note that we shall not make any formal distinction between a node and the variable
to which it corresponds but will simply use the same symbol to refer to both.

An interesting point to note about (8.2) is that the left-hand side is symmetrical
with respect to the three variables a, b, and c, whereas the right-hand side is not.
Indeed, in making the decomposition in (8.2), we have implicitly chosen a particular
ordering, namely a, b, c, and had we chosen a different ordering we would have
obtained a different decomposition and hence a different graphical representation.
We shall return to this point later.

For the moment let us extend the example of Figure 8.1 by considering the joint
distribution over K variables given by p(x1, . . . , xK). By repeated application of
the product rule of probability, this joint distribution can be written as a product of
conditional distributions, one for each of the variables

p(x1, . . . , xK) = p(xK|x1, . . . , xK−1) . . . p(x2|x1)p(x1).

(8.3)

For a given choice of K, we can again represent this as a directed graph having K
nodes, one for each conditional distribution on the right-hand side of (8.3), with each
node having incoming links from all lower numbered nodes. We say that this graph
is fully connected because there is a link between every pair of nodes.

So far, we have worked with completely general joint distributions, so that the
decompositions, and their representations as fully connected graphs, will be applica-
ble to any choice of distribution. As we shall see shortly, it is the absence of links
in the graph that conveys interesting information about the properties of the class of
distributions that the graph represents. Consider the graph shown in Figure 8.2. This
is not a fully connected graph because, for instance, there is no link from x1 to x2 or
from x3 to x7.

We shall now go from this graph to the corresponding representation of the joint
probability distribution written in terms of the product of a set of conditional dis-
tributions, one for each node in the graph. Each such conditional distribution will
be conditioned only on the parents of the corresponding node in the graph. For in-
stance, x5 will be conditioned on x1 and x3. The joint distribution of all 7 variables

is therefore given by

(8.4)

The reader should take a moment to study carefully the correspondence between
(8.4) and Figure 8.2.

K(cid:14)

p(x) =

p(xk|pak)

We can now state in general terms the relationship between a given directed
graph and the corresponding distribution over the variables. The joint distribution
deﬁned by a graph is given by the product, over all of the nodes of the graph, of
a conditional distribution for each node conditioned on the variables corresponding
to the parents of that node in the graph. Thus, for a graph with K nodes, the joint
distribution is given by

k=1

(8.5)
where pak denotes the set of parents of xk, and x = {x1, . . . , xK}. This key
equation expresses the factorization properties of the joint distribution for a directed
graphical model. Although we have considered each node to correspond to a single
variable, we can equally well associate sets of variables and vector-valued variables
with the nodes of a graph. It is easy to show that the representation on the right-
hand side of (8.5) is always correctly normalized provided the individual conditional
distributions are normalized.

The directed graphs that we are considering are subject to an important restric-
tion namely that there must be no directed cycles, in other words there are no closed
paths within the graph such that we can move from node to node along links follow-
ing the direction of the arrows and end up back at the starting node. Such graphs are
also called directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs. This is equivalent to the statement that
there exists an ordering of the nodes such that there are no links that go from any
node to any lower numbered node.

8.1.1 Example: Polynomial regression
As an illustration of the use of directed graphs to describe probability distri-
butions, we consider the Bayesian polynomial regression model introduced in Sec-

tion 1.2.6. The random variables in this model are the vector of polynomial coefﬁ-
cients w and the observed data t = (t1, . . . , tN)T. In addition, this model contains
the input data x = (x1, . . . , xN )T, the noise variance σ2, and the hyperparameter α
representing the precision of the Gaussian prior over w, all of which are parameters
of the model rather than random variables. Focussing just on the random variables
for the moment, we see that the joint distribution is given by the product of the prior
p(w) and N conditional distributions p(tn|w) for n = 1, . . . , N so that

p(t, w) = p(w)

p(tn|w).

(8.6)

n=1

This joint distribution can be represented by a graphical model shown in Figure 8.3.

When we start to deal with more complex models later in the book, we shall ﬁnd
it inconvenient to have to write out multiple nodes of the form t1, . . . , tN explicitly as
in Figure 8.3. We therefore introduce a graphical notation that allows such multiple
nodes to be expressed more compactly, in which we draw a single representative
node tn and then surround this with a box, called a plate, labelled with N indicating
that there are N nodes of this kind. Re-writing the graph of Figure 8.3 in this way,
we obtain the graph shown in Figure 8.4.

We shall sometimes ﬁnd it helpful to make the parameters of a model, as well as

its stochastic variables, explicit. In this case, (8.6) becomes

N(cid:14)

N(cid:14)

p(t, w|x, α, σ2) = p(w|α)

p(tn|w, xn, σ2).

Correspondingly, we can make x and α explicit in the graphical representation. To
do this, we shall adopt the convention that random variables will be denoted by open
circles, and deterministic parameters will be denoted by smaller solid circles. If we
take the graph of Figure 8.4 and include the deterministic parameters, we obtain the
graph shown in Figure 8.5.

When we apply a graphical model to a problem in machine learning or pattern
recognition, we will typically set some of the random variables to speciﬁc observed

values, for example the variables {tn} from the training set in the case of polynomial
curve ﬁtting. In a graphical model, we will denote such observed variables by shad-
ing the corresponding nodes. Thus the graph corresponding to Figure 8.5 in which
the variables {tn} are observed is shown in Figure 8.6. Note that the value of w is
not observed, and so w is an example of a latent variable, also known as a hidden
variable. Such variables play a crucial role in many probabilistic models and will
form the focus of Chapters 9 and 12.
Having observed the values {tn} we can, if desired, evaluate the posterior dis-
tribution of the polynomial coefﬁcients w as discussed in Section 1.2.5. For the
moment, we note that this involves a straightforward application of Bayes’ theorem

where again we have omitted the deterministic parameters in order to keep the nota-

In general, model parameters such as w are of little direct interest in themselves,
because our ultimate goal is to make predictions for new input values. Suppose we

are given a new input value(cid:1)x and we wish to ﬁnd the corresponding probability dis-
tribution for(cid:1)t conditioned on the observed data. The graphical model that describes

this problem is shown in Figure 8.7, and the corresponding joint distribution of all
of the random variables in this model, conditioned on the deterministic parameters,
is then given by

where we are implicitly setting the random variables in t to the speciﬁc values ob-
served in the data set. The details of this calculation were discussed in Chapter 3.

8.1.2 Generative models
There are many situations in which we wish to draw samples from a given prob-
ability distribution. Although we shall devote the whole of Chapter 11 to a detailed
discussion of sampling methods, it is instructive to outline here one technique, called
ancestral sampling, which is particularly relevant to graphical models. Consider a
joint distribution p(x1, . . . , xK) over K variables that factorizes according to (8.5)
corresponding to a directed acyclic graph. We shall suppose that the variables have
been ordered such that there are no links from any node to any lower numbered node,
in other words each node has a higher number than any of its parents. Our goal is to

draw a sample(cid:1)x1, . . . ,(cid:1)xK from the joint distribution.
distribution p(x1), which we call(cid:1)x1. We then work through each of the nodes in or-

To do this, we start with the lowest-numbered node and draw a sample from the
der, so that for node n we draw a sample from the conditional distribution p(xn|pan)
in which the parent variables have been set to their sampled values. Note that at each
stage, these parent values will always be available because they correspond to lower-
numbered nodes that have already been sampled. Techniques for sampling from
speciﬁc distributions will be discussed in detail in Chapter 11. Once we have sam-
pled from the ﬁnal variable xK, we will have achieved our objective of obtaining a
sample from the joint distribution. To obtain a sample from some marginal distribu-
tion corresponding to a subset of the variables, we simply take the sampled values
for the required nodes and ignore the sampled values for the remaining nodes. For
example, to draw a sample from the distribution p(x2, x4), we simply sample from

the full joint distribution and then retain the values(cid:1)x2,(cid:1)x4 and discard the remaining
values {(cid:1)xj(cid:9)=2,4}.

images of objects are created, in which the identity
of an object (a discrete variable) and the position and
orientation of that object (continuous variables) have
independent prior probabilities. The image (a vector
of pixel intensities) has a probability distribution that
is dependent on the identity of the object as well as
on its position and orientation.

For practical applications of probabilistic models, it will typically be the higher-
numbered variables corresponding to terminal nodes of the graph that represent the
observations, with lower-numbered nodes corresponding to latent variables. The
primary role of the latent variables is to allow a complicated distribution over the
observed variables to be represented in terms of a model constructed from simpler
(typically exponential family) conditional distributions.

We can interpret such models as expressing the processes by which the observed
data arose. For instance, consider an object recognition task in which each observed
data point corresponds to an image (comprising a vector of pixel intensities) of one
of the objects. In this case, the latent variables might have an interpretation as the
position and orientation of the object. Given a particular observed image, our goal is
to ﬁnd the posterior distribution over objects, in which we integrate over all possible
positions and orientations. We can represent this problem using a graphical model
of the form show in Figure 8.8.

The graphical model captures the causal process (Pearl, 1988) by which the ob-
served data was generated. For this reason, such models are often called generative
models. By contrast, the polynomial regression model described by Figure 8.5 is
not generative because there is no probability distribution associated with the input
variable x, and so it is not possible to generate synthetic data points from this model.
We could make it generative by introducing a suitable prior distribution p(x), at the
expense of a more complex model.

The hidden variables in a probabilistic model need not, however, have any ex-
plicit physical interpretation but may be introduced simply to allow a more complex
joint distribution to be constructed from simpler components.
In either case, the
technique of ancestral sampling applied to a generative model mimics the creation
of the observed data and would therefore give rise to ‘fantasy’ data whose probability
distribution (if the model were a perfect representation of reality) would be the same
as that of the observed data. In practice, producing synthetic observations from a
generative model can prove informative in understanding the form of the probability
distribution represented by that model.

8.1.3 Discrete variables
We have discussed the importance of probability distributions that are members
of the exponential family, and we have seen that this family includes many well-
known distributions as particular cases. Although such distributions are relatively
simple, they form useful building blocks for constructing more complex probability

distributions, and the framework of graphical models is very useful in expressing the
way in which these building blocks are linked together.

Such models have particularly nice properties if we choose the relationship be-
tween each parent-child pair in a directed graph to be conjugate, and we shall ex-
plore several examples of this shortly. Two cases are particularly worthy of note,
namely when the parent and child node each correspond to discrete variables and
when they each correspond to Gaussian variables, because in these two cases the
relationship can be extended hierarchically to construct arbitrarily complex directed
acyclic graphs. We begin by examining the discrete case.
The probability distribution p(x|µ) for a single discrete variable x having K

possible states (using the 1-of-K representation) is given by

p(x|µ) =

µxk
k

(cid:5)
and is governed by the parameters µ = (µ1, . . . , µK)T. Due to the constraint
k µk = 1, only K − 1 values for µk need to be speciﬁed in order to deﬁne the
Now suppose that we have two discrete variables, x1 and x2, each of which has
K states, and we wish to model their joint distribution. We denote the probability of
observing both x1k = 1 and x2l = 1 by the parameter µkl, where x1k denotes the
kth component of x1, and similarly for x2l. The joint distribution can be written

Because the parameters µkl are subject to the constraint
bution is governed by K 2 − 1 parameters. It is easily seen that the total number of
parameters that must be speciﬁed for an arbitrary joint distribution over M variables
is KM − 1 and therefore grows exponentially with the number M of variables.
Using the product rule, we can factor the joint distribution p(x1, x2) in the form
p(x2|x1)p(x1), which corresponds to a two-node graph with a link going from the
x1 node to the x2 node as shown in Figure 8.9(a). The marginal distribution p(x1)
is governed by K − 1 parameters, as before, Similarly, the conditional distribution
p(x2|x1) requires the speciﬁcation of K − 1 parameters for each of the K possible
values of x1. The total number of parameters that must be speciﬁed in the joint
distribution is therefore (K − 1) + K(K − 1) = K 2 − 1 as before.

Now suppose that the variables x1 and x2 were independent, corresponding to
the graphical model shown in Figure 8.9(b). Each variable is then described by

368

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

Figure 8.10 This chain of M discrete nodes, each
having K states, requires the speciﬁcation of K − 1 +
(M − 1)K(K − 1) parameters, which grows linearly
with the length M of the chain. In contrast, a fully con-
nected graph of M nodes would have KM − 1 param-
eters, which grows exponentially with M.

xM

a separate multinomial distribution, and the total number of parameters would be
2(K − 1). For a distribution over M independent discrete variables, each having K
states, the total number of parameters would be M(K − 1), which therefore grows
linearly with the number of variables. From a graphical perspective, we have reduced
the number of parameters by dropping links in the graph, at the expense of having a
restricted class of distributions.

More generally, if we have M discrete variables x1, . . . , xM , we can model
the joint distribution using a directed graph with one variable corresponding to each
node. The conditional distribution at each node is given by a set of nonnegative pa-
rameters subject to the usual normalization constraint. If the graph is fully connected
then we have a completely general distribution having KM − 1 parameters, whereas
if there are no links in the graph the joint distribution factorizes into the product of
the marginals, and the total number of parameters is M(K − 1). Graphs having in-
termediate levels of connectivity allow for more general distributions than the fully
factorized one while requiring fewer parameters than the general joint distribution.
As an illustration, consider the chain of nodes shown in Figure 8.10. The marginal
distribution p(x1) requires K − 1 parameters, whereas each of the M − 1 condi-
tional distributions p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, requires K(K − 1) parameters.
This gives a total parameter count of K − 1 + (M − 1)K(K − 1), which is quadratic
in K and which grows linearly (rather than exponentially) with the length M of the
chain.

An alternative way to reduce the number of independent parameters in a model
is by sharing parameters (also known as tying of parameters). For instance, in the
chain example of Figure 8.10, we can arrange that all of the conditional distributions
p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, are governed by the same set of K(K−1) parameters.
Together with the K−1 parameters governing the distribution of x1, this gives a total
of K 2 − 1 parameters that must be speciﬁed in order to deﬁne the joint distribution.
We can turn a graph over discrete variables into a Bayesian model by introduc-
ing Dirichlet priors for the parameters. From a graphical point of view, each node
then acquires an additional parent representing the Dirichlet distribution over the pa-
rameters associated with the corresponding discrete node. This is illustrated for the
chain model in Figure 8.11. The corresponding model in which we tie the parame-
ters governing the conditional distributions p(xi|xi−1), for i = 2, . . . , M, is shown
in Figure 8.12.

Another way of controlling the exponential growth in the number of parameters
in models of discrete variables is to use parameterized models for the conditional
distributions instead of complete tables of conditional probability values. To illus-
trate this idea, consider the graph in Figure 8.13 in which all of the nodes represent
binary variables. Each of the parent variables xi is governed by a single parame-

parent nodes. The conditional distribution p(y|x1, . . . , xM ), however, would require
2M parameters representing the probability p(y = 1) for each of the 2M possible
settings of the parent variables. Thus in general the number of parameters required
to specify this conditional distribution will grow exponentially with M. We can ob-
tain a more parsimonious form for the conditional distribution by using a logistic
sigmoid function acting on a linear combination of the parent variables, giving

where σ(a) = (1+exp(−a))−1 is the logistic sigmoid, x = (x0, x1, . . . , xM )T is an
(M + 1)-dimensional vector of parent states augmented with an additional variable
x0 whose value is clamped to 1, and w = (w0, w1, . . . , wM )T is a vector of M + 1
parameters. This is a more restricted form of conditional distribution than the general
case but is now governed by a number of parameters that grows linearly with M. In
this sense, it is analogous to the choice of a restrictive form of covariance matrix (for
example, a diagonal matrix) in a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The motivation
for the logistic sigmoid representation was discussed in Section 4.2.

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

8.1.4 Linear-Gaussian models
In the previous section, we saw how to construct joint probability distributions
over a set of discrete variables by expressing the variables as nodes in a directed
acyclic graph. Here we show how a multivariate Gaussian can be expressed as a
directed graph corresponding to a linear-Gaussian model over the component vari-
ables. This allows us to impose interesting structure on the distribution, with the
general Gaussian and the diagonal covariance Gaussian representing opposite ex-
tremes. Several widely used techniques are examples of linear-Gaussian models,
such as probabilistic principal component analysis, factor analysis, and linear dy-
namical systems (Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999). We shall make extensive use of
the results of this section in later chapters when we consider some of these techniques
in detail.

Consider an arbitrary directed acyclic graph over D variables in which node i
represents a single continuous random variable xi having a Gaussian distribution.
The mean of this distribution is taken to be a linear combination of the states of its
parent nodes pai of node i

p(xi|pai) = N

wijxj + bi, vi

(8.11)

where wij and bi are parameters governing the mean, and vi is the variance of the
conditional distribution for xi. The log of the joint distribution is then the log of the
product of these conditionals over all nodes in the graph and hence takes the form

D(cid:2)

where x = (x1, . . . , xD)T and ‘const’ denotes terms independent of x. We see that
this is a quadratic function of the components of x, and hence the joint distribution
p(x) is a multivariate Gaussian.

We can determine the mean and covariance of the joint distribution recursively
as follows. Each variable xi has (conditional on the states of its parents) a Gaussian
distribution of the form (8.11) and so

√

xi =

wijxj + bi +

vii

(8.14)

where i is a zero mean, unit variance Gaussian random variable satisfying E[i] = 0
and E[ij] = Iij, where Iij is the i, j element of the identity matrix. Taking the
expectation of (8.14), we have

E[xi] =

wij E[xj] + bi.

Thus we can ﬁnd the components of E[x] = (E[x1], . . . , E[xD])T by starting at the
lowest numbered node and working recursively through the graph (here we again
assume that the nodes are numbered such that each node has a higher number than
its parents). Similarly, we can use (8.14) and (8.15) to obtain the i, j element of the
covariance matrix for p(x) in the form of a recursion relation

cov[xi, xj] = E [(xi − E[xi])(xj − E[xj])]

(8.16)

and so the covariance can similarly be evaluated recursively starting from the lowest
numbered node.

Let us consider two extreme cases. First of all, suppose that there are no links
in the graph, which therefore comprises D isolated nodes. In this case, there are no
parameters wij and so there are just D parameters bi and D parameters vi. From
the recursion relations (8.15) and (8.16), we see that the mean of p(x) is given by
(b1, . . . , bD)T and the covariance matrix is diagonal of the form diag(v1, . . . , vD).
The joint distribution has a total of 2D parameters and represents a set of D inde-
pendent univariate Gaussian distributions.
Now consider a fully connected graph in which each node has all lower num-
bered nodes as parents. The matrix wij then has i − 1 entries on the ith row and
hence is a lower triangular matrix (with no entries on the leading diagonal). Then
the total number of parameters wij is obtained by taking the number D2 of elements
in a D× D matrix, subtracting D to account for the absence of elements on the lead-
ing diagonal, and then dividing by 2 because the matrix has elements only below the
diagonal, giving a total of D(D−1)/2. The total number of independent parameters
{wij} and {vi} in the covariance matrix is therefore D(D + 1)/2 corresponding to
a general symmetric covariance matrix.

Graphs having some intermediate level of complexity correspond to joint Gaus-
sian distributions with partially constrained covariance matrices. Consider for ex-
ample the graph shown in Figure 8.14, which has a link missing between variables
x1 and x3. Using the recursion relations (8.15) and (8.16), we see that the mean and
covariance of the joint distribution are given by

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

We can readily extend the linear-Gaussian graphical model to the case in which
the nodes of the graph represent multivariate Gaussian variables. In this case, we can
write the conditional distribution for node i in the form

p(xi|pai) = N

Wijxj + bi, Σi

Section 2.3.6

where now Wij is a matrix (which is nonsquare if xi and xj have different dimen-
sionalities). Again it is easy to verify that the joint distribution over all variables is
Gaussian.

Note that we have already encountered a speciﬁc example of the linear-Gaussian
relationship when we saw that the conjugate prior for the mean µ of a Gaussian
variable x is itself a Gaussian distribution over µ. The joint distribution over x and
µ is therefore Gaussian. This corresponds to a simple two-node graph in which
the node representing µ is the parent of the node representing x. The mean of the
distribution over µ is a parameter controlling a prior, and so it can be viewed as a
hyperparameter. Because the value of this hyperparameter may itself be unknown,
we can again treat it from a Bayesian perspective by introducing a prior over the
hyperparameter, sometimes called a hyperprior, which is again given by a Gaussian
distribution. This type of construction can be extended in principle to any level and is
an illustration of a hierarchical Bayesian model, of which we shall encounter further
examples in later chapters.

8.2. Conditional Independence

An important concept for probability distributions over multiple variables is that of
conditional independence (Dawid, 1980). Consider three variables a, b, and c, and
suppose that the conditional distribution of a, given b and c, is such that it does not
depend on the value of b, so that

p(a|b, c) = p(a|c).

(8.20)

We say that a is conditionally independent of b given c. This can be expressed in a
slightly different way if we consider the joint distribution of a and b conditioned on
c, which we can write in the form

p(a, b|c) = p(a|b, c)p(b|c)
= p(a|c)p(b|c).

(8.21)

where we have used the product rule of probability together with (8.20). Thus we
see that, conditioned on c, the joint distribution of a and b factorizes into the prod-
uct of the marginal distribution of a and the marginal distribution of b (again both
conditioned on c). This says that the variables a and b are statistically independent,
given c. Note that our deﬁnition of conditional independence will require that (8.20),

a, b, and c used to discuss conditional independence
properties of directed graphical models.

b

or equivalently (8.21), must hold for every possible value of c, and not just for some
values. We shall sometimes use a shorthand notation for conditional independence
(Dawid, 1979) in which

a ⊥⊥ b | c

(8.22)

denotes that a is conditionally independent of b given c and is equivalent to (8.20).

Conditional independence properties play an important role in using probabilis-
tic models for pattern recognition by simplifying both the structure of a model and
the computations needed to perform inference and learning under that model. We
shall see examples of this shortly.

If we are given an expression for the joint distribution over a set of variables in
terms of a product of conditional distributions (i.e., the mathematical representation
underlying a directed graph), then we could in principle test whether any poten-
tial conditional independence property holds by repeated application of the sum and
product rules of probability. In practice, such an approach would be very time con-
suming. An important and elegant feature of graphical models is that conditional
independence properties of the joint distribution can be read directly from the graph
without having to perform any analytical manipulations. The general framework
for achieving this is called d-separation, where the ‘d’ stands for ‘directed’ (Pearl,
1988). Here we shall motivate the concept of d-separation and give a general state-
ment of the d-separation criterion. A formal proof can be found in Lauritzen (1996).

8.2.1 Three example graphs
We begin our discussion of the conditional independence properties of directed
graphs by considering three simple examples each involving graphs having just three
nodes. Together, these will motivate and illustrate the key concepts of d-separation.
The ﬁrst of the three examples is shown in Figure 8.15, and the joint distribution
corresponding to this graph is easily written down using the general result (8.5) to
give

(8.23)
If none of the variables are observed, then we can investigate whether a and b are
independent by marginalizing both sides of (8.23) with respect to c to give

p(a, b, c) = p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c).

(cid:2)

p(a, b) =

p(a|c)p(b|c)p(c).

c

In general, this does not factorize into the product p(a)p(b), and so

a (cid:9)⊥⊥ b | ∅

(8.24)

(8.25)

374

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

Figure 8.16 As in Figure 8.15 but where we have conditioned on the

value of variable c.

c

a

b

where ∅ denotes the empty set, and the symbol (cid:9)⊥⊥ means that the conditional inde-
pendence property does not hold in general. Of course, it may hold for a particular
distribution by virtue of the speciﬁc numerical values associated with the various
conditional probabilities, but it does not follow in general from the structure of the
graph.

Now suppose we condition on the variable c, as represented by the graph of
Figure 8.16. From (8.23), we can easily write down the conditional distribution of a
and b, given c, in the form

p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c)
p(c)

= p(a|c)p(b|c)

and so we obtain the conditional independence property

a ⊥⊥ b | c.

We can provide a simple graphical interpretation of this result by considering
the path from node a to node b via c. The node c is said to be tail-to-tail with re-
spect to this path because the node is connected to the tails of the two arrows, and
the presence of such a path connecting nodes a and b causes these nodes to be de-
pendent. However, when we condition on node c, as in Figure 8.16, the conditioned
node ‘blocks’ the path from a to b and causes a and b to become (conditionally)
independent.

We can similarly consider the graph shown in Figure 8.17. The joint distribution
corresponding to this graph is again obtained from our general formula (8.5) to give

p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(c|a)p(b|c).

(8.26)

First of all, suppose that none of the variables are observed. Again, we can test to
see if a and b are independent by marginalizing over c to give

(cid:2)

p(a, b) = p(a)

p(c|a)p(b|c) = p(a)p(b|a).

which in general does not factorize into p(a)p(b), and so

as before.

Now suppose we condition on node c, as shown in Figure 8.18. Using Bayes’

theorem, together with (8.26), we obtain

p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c)
p(c)

= p(a)p(c|a)p(b|c)
p(c)
= p(a|c)p(b|c)

and so again we obtain the conditional independence property

a ⊥⊥ b | c.

As before, we can interpret these results graphically. The node c is said to be
head-to-tail with respect to the path from node a to node b. Such a path connects
nodes a and b and renders them dependent. If we now observe c, as in Figure 8.18,
then this observation ‘blocks’ the path from a to b and so we obtain the conditional
independence property a ⊥⊥ b | c.

Finally, we consider the third of our 3-node examples, shown by the graph in
Figure 8.19. As we shall see, this has a more subtle behaviour than the two previous
graphs.

The joint distribution can again be written down using our general result (8.5) to

give

p(a, b, c) = p(a)p(b)p(c|a, b).

(8.28)

Consider ﬁrst the case where none of the variables are observed. Marginalizing both
sides of (8.28) over c we obtain

p(a, b) = p(a)p(b)

explore conditional independence properties in graphi-
cal models. This graph has rather different properties
from the two previous examples.

dence between a and b.

a

and so a and b are independent with no variables observed, in contrast to the two
previous examples. We can write this result as
a ⊥⊥ b | ∅.

(8.29)

Now suppose we condition on c, as indicated in Figure 8.20. The conditional distri-
bution of a and b is then given by

p(a, b|c) = p(a, b, c)
p(c)

= p(a)p(b)p(c|a, b)

p(c)

Exercise 8.10

which in general does not factorize into the product p(a)p(b), and so

a (cid:9)⊥⊥ b | c.

Thus our third example has the opposite behaviour from the ﬁrst two. Graphically,
we say that node c is head-to-head with respect to the path from a to b because it
connects to the heads of the two arrows. When node c is unobserved, it ‘blocks’
the path, and the variables a and b are independent. However, conditioning on c
‘unblocks’ the path and renders a and b dependent.

There is one more subtlety associated with this third example that we need to
consider. First we introduce some more terminology. We say that node y is a de-
scendant of node x if there is a path from x to y in which each step of the path
follows the directions of the arrows. Then it can be shown that a head-to-head path
will become unblocked if either the node, or any of its descendants, is observed.

In summary, a tail-to-tail node or a head-to-tail node leaves a path unblocked
unless it is observed in which case it blocks the path. By contrast, a head-to-head
node blocks a path if it is unobserved, but once the node, and/or at least one of its
descendants, is observed the path becomes unblocked.

It is worth spending a moment to understand further the unusual behaviour of the
graph of Figure 8.20. Consider a particular instance of such a graph corresponding
to a problem with three binary random variables relating to the fuel system on a car,
as shown in Figure 8.21. The variables are called B, representing the state of a
battery that is either charged (B = 1) or ﬂat (B = 0), F representing the state of
the fuel tank that is either full of fuel (F = 1) or empty (F = 0), and G, which is
the state of an electric fuel gauge and which indicates either full (G = 1) or empty

gauge (G). See the text for details.

(G = 0). The battery is either charged or ﬂat, and independently the fuel tank is
either full or empty, with prior probabilities

p(B = 1) = 0.9
p(F = 1) = 0.9.

Given the state of the fuel tank and the battery, the fuel gauge reads full with proba-
bilities given by

p(G = 1|B = 1, F = 1) = 0.8
p(G = 1|B = 1, F = 0) = 0.2
p(G = 1|B = 0, F = 1) = 0.2
p(G = 1|B = 0, F = 0) = 0.1

so this is a rather unreliable fuel gauge! All remaining probabilities are determined
by the requirement that probabilities sum to one, and so we have a complete speciﬁ-
cation of the probabilistic model.

Before we observe any data, the prior probability of the fuel tank being empty
is p(F = 0) = 0.1. Now suppose that we observe the fuel gauge and discover that
it reads empty, i.e., G = 0, corresponding to the middle graph in Figure 8.21. We
can use Bayes’ theorem to evaluate the posterior probability of the fuel tank being
empty. First we evaluate the denominator for Bayes’ theorem given by
p(G = 0|B, F )p(B)p(F ) = 0.315

p(G = 0) =

(cid:2)

(8.30)

B∈{0,1}

F∈{0,1}

(cid:2)
(cid:2)

B∈{0,1}

and similarly we evaluate
p(G = 0|F = 0) =

p(G = 0|B, F = 0)p(B) = 0.81

(8.31)

and using these results we have

p(F = 0|G = 0) = p(G = 0|F = 0)p(F = 0)

p(G = 0)

(cid:7) 0.257

(8.32)

378

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

and so p(F = 0|G = 0) > p(F = 0). Thus observing that the gauge reads empty
makes it more likely that the tank is indeed empty, as we would intuitively expect.
Next suppose that we also check the state of the battery and ﬁnd that it is ﬂat, i.e.,
B = 0. We have now observed the states of both the fuel gauge and the battery, as
shown by the right-hand graph in Figure 8.21. The posterior probability that the fuel
tank is empty given the observations of both the fuel gauge and the battery state is
then given by

(cid:5)

p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) = p(G = 0|B = 0, F = 0)p(F = 0)
F∈{0,1} p(G = 0|B = 0, F )p(F )

(cid:7) 0.111 (8.33)

where the prior probability p(B = 0) has cancelled between numerator and denom-
inator. Thus the probability that the tank is empty has decreased (from 0.257 to
0.111) as a result of the observation of the state of the battery. This accords with our
intuition that ﬁnding out that the battery is ﬂat explains away the observation that the
fuel gauge reads empty. We see that the state of the fuel tank and that of the battery
have indeed become dependent on each other as a result of observing the reading
on the fuel gauge. In fact, this would also be the case if, instead of observing the
fuel gauge directly, we observed the state of some descendant of G. Note that the
probability p(F = 0|G = 0, B = 0) (cid:7) 0.111 is greater than the prior probability
p(F = 0) = 0.1 because the observation that the fuel gauge reads zero still provides
some evidence in favour of an empty fuel tank.

8.2.2 D-separation
We now give a general statement of the d-separation property (Pearl, 1988) for
directed graphs. Consider a general directed graph in which A, B, and C are arbi-
trary nonintersecting sets of nodes (whose union may be smaller than the complete
set of nodes in the graph). We wish to ascertain whether a particular conditional
independence statement A ⊥⊥ B | C is implied by a given directed acyclic graph. To
do so, we consider all possible paths from any node in A to any node in B. Any such
path is said to be blocked if it includes a node such that either

(a) the arrows on the path meet either head-to-tail or tail-to-tail at the node, and the

node is in the set C, or

(b) the arrows meet head-to-head at the node, and neither the node, nor any of its

descendants, is in the set C.

If all paths are blocked, then A is said to be d-separated from B by C, and the joint
distribution over all of the variables in the graph will satisfy A ⊥⊥ B | C.

The concept of d-separation is illustrated in Figure 8.22. In graph (a), the path
from a to b is not blocked by node f because it is a tail-to-tail node for this path
and is not observed, nor is it blocked by node e because, although the latter is a
head-to-head node, it has a descendant c because is in the conditioning set. Thus
the conditional independence statement a ⊥⊥ b | c does not follow from this graph.
In graph (b), the path from a to b is blocked by node f because this is a tail-to-tail
node that is observed, and so the conditional independence property a ⊥⊥ b | f will

cept of d-separation. See the text for

be satisﬁed by any distribution that factorizes according to this graph. Note that this
path is also blocked by node e because e is a head-to-head node and neither it nor its
descendant are in the conditioning set.

For the purposes of d-separation, parameters such as α and σ2 in Figure 8.5,
indicated by small ﬁlled circles, behave in the same was as observed nodes. How-
ever, there are no marginal distributions associated with such nodes. Consequently
parameter nodes never themselves have parents and so all paths through these nodes
will always be tail-to-tail and hence blocked. Consequently they play no role in
d-separation.

Section 2.3

Another example of conditional independence and d-separation is provided by
the concept of i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) data introduced in Sec-
tion 1.2.4. Consider the problem of ﬁnding the posterior distribution for the mean
of a univariate Gaussian distribution. This can be represented by the directed graph
shown in Figure 8.23 in which the joint distribution is deﬁned by a prior p(µ) to-
gether with a set of conditional distributions p(xn|µ) for n = 1, . . . , N. In practice,
we observe D = {x1, . . . , xN} and our goal is to infer µ. Suppose, for a moment,
that we condition on µ and consider the joint distribution of the observations. Using
d-separation, we note that there is a unique path from any xi to any other xj(cid:9)=i and
that this path is tail-to-tail with respect to the observed node µ. Every such path is
blocked and so the observations D = {x1, . . . , xN} are independent given µ, so that

Here µ is a latent variable, because its value is not observed.

Another example of a model representing i.i.d. data is the graph in Figure 8.7
corresponding to Bayesian polynomial regression. Here the stochastic nodes corre-

spond to {tn}, w and(cid:1)t. We see that the node for w is tail-to-tail with respect to
the path from(cid:1)t to any one of the nodes tn and so we have the following conditional
(cid:1)t ⊥⊥ tn | w.
(cid:1)t is independent of the training data {t1, . . . , tN}. We can therefore ﬁrst use the
predictions of(cid:1)t for new input observations(cid:1)x.

(8.36)
Thus, conditioned on the polynomial coefﬁcients w, the predictive distribution for

training data to determine the posterior distribution over the coefﬁcients w and then
we can discard the training data and use the posterior distribution for w to make

A related graphical structure arises in an approach to classiﬁcation called the
naive Bayes model, in which we use conditional independence assumptions to sim-
plify the model structure. Suppose our observed variable consists of a D-dimensional
vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T, and we wish to assign observed values of x to one of K
classes. Using the 1-of-K encoding scheme, we can represent these classes by a K-
dimensional binary vector z. We can then deﬁne a generative model by introducing
a multinomial prior p(z|µ) over the class labels, where the kth component µk of µ
is the prior probability of class Ck, together with a conditional distribution p(x|z)
for the observed vector x. The key assumption of the naive Bayes model is that,
conditioned on the class z, the distributions of the input variables x1, . . . , xD are in-
dependent. The graphical representation of this model is shown in Figure 8.24. We
see that observation of z blocks the path between xi and xj for j (cid:9)= i (because such
paths are tail-to-tail at the node z) and so xi and xj are conditionally independent
given z. If, however, we marginalize out z (so that z is unobserved) the tail-to-tail
path from xi to xj is no longer blocked. This tells us that in general the marginal
density p(x) will not factorize with respect to the components of x. We encountered
a simple application of the naive Bayes model in the context of fusing data from
different sources for medical diagnosis in Section 1.5.
If we are given a labelled training set, comprising inputs {x1, . . . , xN} together
with their class labels, then we can ﬁt the naive Bayes model to the training data

8.2. Conditional Independence

using maximum likelihood assuming that the data are drawn independently from
the model. The solution is obtained by ﬁtting the model for each class separately
using the correspondingly labelled data. As an example, suppose that the probability
density within each class is chosen to be Gaussian. In this case, the naive Bayes
assumption then implies that the covariance matrix for each Gaussian is diagonal,
and the contours of constant density within each class will be axis-aligned ellipsoids.
The marginal density, however, is given by a superposition of diagonal Gaussians
(with weighting coefﬁcients given by the class priors) and so will no longer factorize
with respect to its components.

The naive Bayes assumption is helpful when the dimensionality D of the input
space is high, making density estimation in the full D-dimensional space more chal-
lenging. It is also useful if the input vector contains both discrete and continuous
variables, since each can be represented separately using appropriate models (e.g.,
Bernoulli distributions for binary observations or Gaussians for real-valued vari-
ables). The conditional independence assumption of this model is clearly a strong
one that may lead to rather poor representations of the class-conditional densities.
Nevertheless, even if this assumption is not precisely satisﬁed, the model may still
give good classiﬁcation performance in practice because the decision boundaries can
be insensitive to some of the details in the class-conditional densities, as illustrated
in Figure 1.27.

We have seen that a particular directed graph represents a speciﬁc decomposition
of a joint probability distribution into a product of conditional probabilities. The
graph also expresses a set of conditional independence statements obtained through
the d-separation criterion, and the d-separation theorem is really an expression of the
equivalence of these two properties. In order to make this clear, it is helpful to think
of a directed graph as a ﬁlter. Suppose we consider a particular joint probability
distribution p(x) over the variables x corresponding to the (nonobserved) nodes of
the graph. The ﬁlter will allow this distribution to pass through if, and only if, it can
be expressed in terms of the factorization (8.5) implied by the graph. If we present to
the ﬁlter the set of all possible distributions p(x) over the set of variables x, then the
subset of distributions that are passed by the ﬁlter will be denoted DF, for directed
factorization. This is illustrated in Figure 8.25. Alternatively, we can use the graph as
a different kind of ﬁlter by ﬁrst listing all of the conditional independence properties
obtained by applying the d-separation criterion to the graph, and then allowing a
distribution to pass only if it satisﬁes all of these properties. If we present all possible
distributions p(x) to this second kind of ﬁlter, then the d-separation theorem tells us
that the set of distributions that will be allowed through is precisely the set DF.

It should be emphasized that the conditional independence properties obtained
from d-separation apply to any probabilistic model described by that particular di-
rected graph. This will be true, for instance, whether the variables are discrete or
continuous or a combination of these. Again, we see that a particular graph is de-
scribing a whole family of probability distributions.

At one extreme we have a fully connected graph that exhibits no conditional in-
dependence properties at all, and which can represent any possible joint probability
distribution over the given variables. The set DF will contain all possible distribu-

Figure 8.25 We can view a graphical model (in this case a directed graph) as a ﬁlter in which a prob-
ability distribution p(x) is allowed through the ﬁlter if, and only if, it satisﬁes the directed
factorization property (8.5). The set of all possible probability distributions p(x) that pass
through the ﬁlter is denoted DF. We can alternatively use the graph to ﬁlter distributions
according to whether they respect all of the conditional independencies implied by the
d-separation properties of the graph. The d-separation theorem says that it is the same
set of distributions DF that will be allowed through this second kind of ﬁlter.

tions p(x). At the other extreme, we have the fully disconnected graph, i.e., one
having no links at all. This corresponds to joint distributions which factorize into the
product of the marginal distributions over the variables comprising the nodes of the
graph.
Note that for any given graph, the set of distributions DF will include any dis-
tributions that have additional independence properties beyond those described by
the graph. For instance, a fully factorized distribution will always be passed through
the ﬁlter implied by any graph over the corresponding set of variables.

We end our discussion of conditional independence properties by exploring the
concept of a Markov blanket or Markov boundary. Consider a joint distribution
p(x1, . . . , xD) represented by a directed graph having D nodes, and consider the
conditional distribution of a particular node with variables xi conditioned on all of
the remaining variables xj(cid:9)=i. Using the factorization property (8.5), we can express
this conditional distribution in the form
p(xi|x{j(cid:9)=i}) =

p(x1, . . . , xD)

in which the integral is replaced by a summation in the case of discrete variables. We
now observe that any factor p(xk|pak) that does not have any functional dependence
on xi can be taken outside the integral over xi, and will therefore cancel between
numerator and denominator. The only factors that remain will be the conditional
distribution p(xi|pai) for node xi itself, together with the conditional distributions
for any nodes xk such that node xi is in the conditioning set of p(xk|pak), in other
words for which xi is a parent of xk. The conditional p(xi|pai) will depend on the
parents of node xi, whereas the conditionals p(xk|pak) will depend on the children

of xi as well as on the co-parents, in other words variables corresponding to parents
of node xk other than node xi. The set of nodes comprising the parents, the children
and the co-parents is called the Markov blanket and is illustrated in Figure 8.26. We
can think of the Markov blanket of a node xi as being the minimal set of nodes that
isolates xi from the rest of the graph. Note that it is not sufﬁcient to include only the
parents and children of node xi because the phenomenon of explaining away means
that observations of the child nodes will not block paths to the co-parents. We must
therefore observe the co-parent nodes also.

8.3. Markov Random Fields

We have seen that directed graphical models specify a factorization of the joint dis-
tribution over a set of variables into a product of local conditional distributions. They
also deﬁne a set of conditional independence properties that must be satisﬁed by any
distribution that factorizes according to the graph. We turn now to the second ma-
jor class of graphical models that are described by undirected graphs and that again
specify both a factorization and a set of conditional independence relations.

A Markov random ﬁeld, also known as a Markov network or an undirected
graphical model (Kindermann and Snell, 1980), has a set of nodes each of which
corresponds to a variable or group of variables, as well as a set of links each of
which connects a pair of nodes. The links are undirected, that is they do not carry
arrows. In the case of undirected graphs, it is convenient to begin with a discussion
of conditional independence properties.

8.3.1 Conditional independence properties
In the case of directed graphs, we saw that it was possible to test whether a par-
ticular conditional independence property holds by applying a graphical test called
d-separation. This involved testing whether or not the paths connecting two sets of
nodes were ‘blocked’. The deﬁnition of blocked, however, was somewhat subtle
due to the presence of paths having head-to-head nodes. We might ask whether it
is possible to deﬁne an alternative graphical semantics for probability distributions
such that conditional independence is determined by simple graph separation. This
is indeed the case and corresponds to undirected graphical models. By removing the

directionality from the links of the graph, the asymmetry between parent and child
nodes is removed, and so the subtleties associated with head-to-head nodes no longer
arise.

Suppose that in an undirected graph we identify three sets of nodes, denoted A,

B, and C, and that we consider the conditional independence property

A ⊥⊥ B | C.

(8.37)

To test whether this property is satisﬁed by a probability distribution deﬁned by a
graph we consider all possible paths that connect nodes in set A to nodes in set
B. If all such paths pass through one or more nodes in set C, then all such paths are
‘blocked’ and so the conditional independence property holds. However, if there is at
least one such path that is not blocked, then the property does not necessarily hold, or
more precisely there will exist at least some distributions corresponding to the graph
that do not satisfy this conditional independence relation. This is illustrated with an
example in Figure 8.27. Note that this is exactly the same as the d-separation crite-
rion except that there is no ‘explaining away’ phenomenon. Testing for conditional
independence in undirected graphs is therefore simpler than in directed graphs.

An alternative way to view the conditional independence test is to imagine re-
moving all nodes in set C from the graph together with any links that connect to
those nodes. We then ask if there exists a path that connects any node in A to any
node in B. If there are no such paths, then the conditional independence property
must hold.

The Markov blanket for an undirected graph takes a particularly simple form,
because a node will be conditionally independent of all other nodes conditioned only
on the neighbouring nodes, as illustrated in Figure 8.28.

8.3.2 Factorization properties
We now seek a factorization rule for undirected graphs that will correspond to
the above conditional independence test. Again, this will involve expressing the joint
distribution p(x) as a product of functions deﬁned over sets of variables that are local
to the graph. We therefore need to decide what is the appropriate notion of locality
in this case.

8.3. Markov Random Fields

385

Figure 8.28 For an undirected graph, the Markov blanket of a node
xi consists of the set of neighbouring nodes.
It has the
property that the conditional distribution of xi, conditioned
on all the remaining variables in the graph, is dependent
only on the variables in the Markov blanket.

If we consider two nodes xi and xj that are not connected by a link, then these
variables must be conditionally independent given all other nodes in the graph. This
follows from the fact that there is no direct path between the two nodes, and all other
paths pass through nodes that are observed, and hence those paths are blocked. This
conditional independence property can be expressed as

p(xi, xj|x\{i,j}) = p(xi|x\{i,j})p(xj|x\{i,j})

(8.38)

where x\{i,j} denotes the set x of all variables with xi and xj removed. The factor-
ization of the joint distribution must therefore be such that xi and xj do not appear
in the same factor in order for the conditional independence property to hold for all
possible distributions belonging to the graph.

This leads us to consider a graphical concept called a clique, which is deﬁned
as a subset of the nodes in a graph such that there exists a link between all pairs of
nodes in the subset. In other words, the set of nodes in a clique is fully connected.
Furthermore, a maximal clique is a clique such that it is not possible to include any
other nodes from the graph in the set without it ceasing to be a clique. These concepts
are illustrated by the undirected graph over four variables shown in Figure 8.29. This
graph has ﬁve cliques of two nodes given by {x1, x2}, {x2, x3}, {x3, x4}, {x4, x2},
and {x1, x3}, as well as two maximal cliques given by {x1, x2, x3} and {x2, x3, x4}.
The set {x1, x2, x3, x4} is not a clique because of the missing link from x1 to x4.

We can therefore deﬁne the factors in the decomposition of the joint distribution
to be functions of the variables in the cliques. In fact, we can consider functions
of the maximal cliques, without loss of generality, because other cliques must be
subsets of maximal cliques. Thus, if {x1, x2, x3} is a maximal clique and we deﬁne
an arbitrary function over this clique, then including another factor deﬁned over a
subset of these variables would be redundant.

Let us denote a clique by C and the set of variables in that clique by xC. Then

which ensures that the distribution p(x) given by (8.39) is correctly normalized.
By considering only potential functions which satisfy ψC(xC) (cid:2) 0 we ensure that
p(x) (cid:2) 0. In (8.40) we have assumed that x comprises discrete variables, but the
framework is equally applicable to continuous variables, or a combination of the two,
in which the summation is replaced by the appropriate combination of summation
and integration.

Note that we do not restrict the choice of potential functions to those that have a
speciﬁc probabilistic interpretation as marginal or conditional distributions. This is
in contrast to directed graphs in which each factor represents the conditional distribu-
tion of the corresponding variable, conditioned on the state of its parents. However,
in special cases, for instance where the undirected graph is constructed by starting
with a directed graph, the potential functions may indeed have such an interpretation,
as we shall see shortly.

One consequence of the generality of the potential functions ψC(xC) is that
their product will in general not be correctly normalized. We therefore have to in-
troduce an explicit normalization factor given by (8.40). Recall that for directed
graphs, the joint distribution was automatically normalized as a consequence of the
normalization of each of the conditional distributions in the factorization.

The presence of this normalization constant is one of the major limitations of
undirected graphs. If we have a model with M discrete nodes each having K states,
then the evaluation of the normalization term involves summing over KM states and
so (in the worst case) is exponential in the size of the model. The partition function
is needed for parameter learning because it will be a function of any parameters that
govern the potential functions ψC(xC). However, for evaluation of local conditional
distributions, the partition function is not needed because a conditional is the ratio
of two marginals, and the partition function cancels between numerator and denom-
inator when evaluating this ratio. Similarly, for evaluating local marginal probabil-
ities we can work with the unnormalized joint distribution and then normalize the
marginals explicitly at the end. Provided the marginals only involves a small number
of variables, the evaluation of their normalization coefﬁcient will be feasible.

So far, we have discussed the notion of conditional independence based on sim-
ple graph separation and we have proposed a factorization of the joint distribution
that is intended to correspond to this conditional independence structure. However,
we have not made any formal connection between conditional independence and
factorization for undirected graphs. To do so we need to restrict attention to poten-
tial functions ψC(xC) that are strictly positive (i.e., never zero or negative for any

8.3. Markov Random Fields

387

choice of xC). Given this restriction, we can make a precise relationship between
factorization and conditional independence.

To do this we again return to the concept of a graphical model as a ﬁlter, corre-
sponding to Figure 8.25. Consider the set of all possible distributions deﬁned over
a ﬁxed set of variables corresponding to the nodes of a particular undirected graph.
We can deﬁne UI to be the set of such distributions that are consistent with the set
of conditional independence statements that can be read from the graph using graph
separation. Similarly, we can deﬁne UF to be the set of such distributions that can
be expressed as a factorization of the form (8.39) with respect to the maximal cliques
of the graph. The Hammersley-Clifford theorem (Clifford, 1990) states that the sets
UI and UF are identical.

Because we are restricted to potential functions which are strictly positive it is

convenient to express them as exponentials, so that

ψC(xC) = exp{−E(xC)}

(8.41)

where E(xC) is called an energy function, and the exponential representation is
called the Boltzmann distribution. The joint distribution is deﬁned as the product of
potentials, and so the total energy is obtained by adding the energies of each of the
maximal cliques.

In contrast to the factors in the joint distribution for a directed graph, the po-
tentials in an undirected graph do not have a speciﬁc probabilistic interpretation.
Although this gives greater ﬂexibility in choosing the potential functions, because
there is no normalization constraint, it does raise the question of how to motivate a
choice of potential function for a particular application. This can be done by view-
ing the potential function as expressing which conﬁgurations of the local variables
are preferred to others. Global conﬁgurations that have a relatively high probability
are those that ﬁnd a good balance in satisfying the (possibly conﬂicting) inﬂuences
of the clique potentials. We turn now to a speciﬁc example to illustrate the use of
undirected graphs.

8.3.3 Illustration: Image de-noising
We can illustrate the application of undirected graphs using an example of noise
removal from a binary image (Besag, 1974; Geman and Geman, 1984; Besag, 1986).
Although a very simple example, this is typical of more sophisticated applications.
Let the observed noisy image be described by an array of binary pixel values yi ∈
{−1, +1}, where the index i = 1, . . . , D runs over all pixels. We shall suppose
that the image is obtained by taking an unknown noise-free image, described by
binary pixel values xi ∈ {−1, +1} and randomly ﬂipping the sign of pixels with
some small probability. An example binary image, together with a noise corrupted
image obtained by ﬂipping the sign of the pixels with probability 10%, is shown in
Figure 8.30. Given the noisy image, our goal is to recover the original noise-free
image.

Because the noise level is small, we know that there will be a strong correlation
between xi and yi. We also know that neighbouring pixels xi and xj in an image
are strongly correlated. This prior knowledge can be captured using the Markov

binary image on the left and the corrupted image after randomly changing 10% of the pixels on the right. The

random ﬁeld model whose undirected graph is shown in Figure 8.31. This graph has
two types of cliques, each of which contains two variables. The cliques of the form
{xi, yi} have an associated energy function that expresses the correlation between
these variables. We choose a very simple energy function for these cliques of the
form −ηxiyi where η is a positive constant. This has the desired effect of giving a
lower energy (thus encouraging a higher probability) when xi and yi have the same
sign and a higher energy when they have the opposite sign.
The remaining cliques comprise pairs of variables {xi, xj} where i and j are
indices of neighbouring pixels. Again, we want the energy to be lower when the
pixels have the same sign than when they have the opposite sign, and so we choose
an energy given by −βxixj where β is a positive constant.

Because a potential function is an arbitrary, nonnegative function over a maximal
clique, we can multiply it by any nonnegative functions of subsets of the clique, or

equivalently we can add the corresponding energies. In this example, this allows us
to add an extra term hxi for each pixel i in the noise-free image. Such a term has
the effect of biasing the model towards pixel values that have one particular sign in
preference to the other.

We now ﬁx the elements of y to the observed values given by the pixels of the
noisy image, which implicitly deﬁnes a conditional distribution p(x|y) over noise-
free images. This is an example of the Ising model, which has been widely studied in
statistical physics. For the purposes of image restoration, we wish to ﬁnd an image x
having a high probability (ideally the maximum probability). To do this we shall use
a simple iterative technique called iterated conditional modes, or ICM (Kittler and
F¨oglein, 1984), which is simply an application of coordinate-wise gradient ascent.
The idea is ﬁrst to initialize the variables {xi}, which we do by simply setting xi =
yi for all i. Then we take one node xj at a time and we evaluate the total energy
for the two possible states xj = +1 and xj = −1, keeping all other node variables
ﬁxed, and set xj to whichever state has the lower energy. This will either leave
the probability unchanged, if xj is unchanged, or will increase it. Because only
one variable is changed, this is a simple local computation that can be performed
efﬁciently. We then repeat the update for another site, and so on, until some suitable
stopping criterion is satisﬁed. The nodes may be updated in a systematic way, for
instance by repeatedly raster scanning through the image, or by choosing nodes at
random.

If we have a sequence of updates in which every site is visited at least once,
and in which no changes to the variables are made, then by deﬁnition the algorithm

will have converged to a local maximum of the probability. This need not, however,
correspond to the global maximum.

For the purposes of this simple illustration, we have ﬁxed the parameters to be
β = 1.0, η = 2.1 and h = 0. Note that leaving h = 0 simply means that the prior
probabilities of the two states of xi are equal. Starting with the observed noisy image
as the initial conﬁguration, we run ICM until convergence, leading to the de-noised
image shown in the lower left panel of Figure 8.30. Note that if we set β = 0,
which effectively removes the links between neighbouring pixels, then the global
most probable solution is given by xi = yi for all i, corresponding to the observed
noisy image.

Later we shall discuss a more effective algorithm for ﬁnding high probability so-
lutions called the max-product algorithm, which typically leads to better solutions,
although this is still not guaranteed to ﬁnd the global maximum of the posterior dis-
tribution. However, for certain classes of model, including the one given by (8.42),
there exist efﬁcient algorithms based on graph cuts that are guaranteed to ﬁnd the
global maximum (Greig et al., 1989; Boykov et al., 2001; Kolmogorov and Zabih,
2004). The lower right panel of Figure 8.30 shows the result of applying a graph-cut
algorithm to the de-noising problem.

8.3.4 Relation to directed graphs
We have introduced two graphical frameworks for representing probability dis-
tributions, corresponding to directed and undirected graphs, and it is instructive to
discuss the relation between these. Consider ﬁrst the problem of taking a model that
is speciﬁed using a directed graph and trying to convert it to an undirected graph. In
some cases this is straightforward, as in the simple example in Figure 8.32. Here the
joint distribution for the directed graph is given as a product of conditionals in the
form

p(x) = p(x1)p(x2|x1)p(x3|x2)··· p(xN|xN−1).

(8.44)

Now let us convert this to an undirected graph representation, as shown in Fig-
ure 8.32. In the undirected graph, the maximal cliques are simply the pairs of neigh-
bouring nodes, and so from (8.39) we wish to write the joint distribution in the form

p(x) =

1
Z

ψ1,2(x1, x2)ψ2,3(x2, x3)··· ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN).

...

where we have absorbed the marginal p(x1) for the ﬁrst node into the ﬁrst potential
function. Note that in this case, the partition function Z = 1.

Let us consider how to generalize this construction, so that we can convert any
distribution speciﬁed by a factorization over a directed graph into one speciﬁed by a
factorization over an undirected graph. This can be achieved if the clique potentials
of the undirected graph are given by the conditional distributions of the directed
graph. In order for this to be valid, we must ensure that the set of variables that
appears in each of the conditional distributions is a member of at least one clique of
the undirected graph. For nodes on the directed graph having just one parent, this is
achieved simply by replacing the directed link with an undirected link. However, for
nodes in the directed graph having more than one parent, this is not sufﬁcient. These
are nodes that have ‘head-to-head’ paths encountered in our discussion of conditional
independence. Consider a simple directed graph over 4 nodes shown in Figure 8.33.
The joint distribution for the directed graph takes the form

p(x) = p(x1)p(x2)p(x3)p(x4|x1, x2, x3).

(8.46)
We see that the factor p(x4|x1, x2, x3) involves the four variables x1, x2, x3, and
x4, and so these must all belong to a single clique if this conditional distribution is
to be absorbed into a clique potential. To ensure this, we add extra links between
all pairs of parents of the node x4. Anachronistically, this process of ‘marrying
the parents’ has become known as moralization, and the resulting undirected graph,
after dropping the arrows, is called the moral graph. It is important to observe that
the moral graph in this example is fully connected and so exhibits no conditional
independence properties, in contrast to the original directed graph.

Thus in general to convert a directed graph into an undirected graph, we ﬁrst add
additional undirected links between all pairs of parents for each node in the graph and

392

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

Section 8.4

Section 8.2

then drop the arrows on the original links to give the moral graph. Then we initialize
all of the clique potentials of the moral graph to 1. We then take each conditional
distribution factor in the original directed graph and multiply it into one of the clique
potentials. There will always exist at least one maximal clique that contains all of
the variables in the factor as a result of the moralization step. Note that in all cases
the partition function is given by Z = 1.

The process of converting a directed graph into an undirected graph plays an
important role in exact inference techniques such as the junction tree algorithm.
Converting from an undirected to a directed representation is much less common
and in general presents problems due to the normalization constraints.

We saw that in going from a directed to an undirected representation we had to
discard some conditional independence properties from the graph. Of course, we
could always trivially convert any distribution over a directed graph into one over an
undirected graph by simply using a fully connected undirected graph. This would,
however, discard all conditional independence properties and so would be vacuous.
The process of moralization adds the fewest extra links and so retains the maximum
number of independence properties.

We have seen that the procedure for determining the conditional independence
properties is different between directed and undirected graphs. It turns out that the
two types of graph can express different conditional independence properties, and
it is worth exploring this issue in more detail. To do so, we return to the view of
a speciﬁc (directed or undirected) graph as a ﬁlter, so that the set of all possible
distributions over the given variables could be reduced to a subset that respects the
conditional independencies implied by the graph. A graph is said to be a D map
(for ‘dependency map’) of a distribution if every conditional independence statement
satisﬁed by the distribution is reﬂected in the graph. Thus a completely disconnected
graph (no links) will be a trivial D map for any distribution.

Alternatively, we can consider a speciﬁc distribution and ask which graphs have
the appropriate conditional independence properties. If every conditional indepen-
dence statement implied by a graph is satisﬁed by a speciﬁc distribution, then the
graph is said to be an I map (for ‘independence map’) of that distribution. Clearly a
fully connected graph will be a trivial I map for any distribution.

If it is the case that every conditional independence property of the distribution
is reﬂected in the graph, and vice versa, then the graph is said to be a perfect map for

that distribution. A perfect map is therefore both an I map and a D map.

Consider the set of distributions such that for each distribution there exists a
directed graph that is a perfect map. This set is distinct from the set of distributions
such that for each distribution there exists an undirected graph that is a perfect map.
In addition there are distributions for which neither directed nor undirected graphs
offer a perfect map. This is illustrated as a Venn diagram in Figure 8.34.
Figure 8.35 shows an example of a directed graph that is a perfect map for
a distribution satisfying the conditional independence properties A ⊥⊥ B | ∅ and
A (cid:9)⊥⊥ B | C. There is no corresponding undirected graph over the same three vari-
ables that is a perfect map.
Conversely, consider the undirected graph over four variables shown in Fig-
ure 8.36. This graph exhibits the properties A (cid:9)⊥⊥ B | ∅, C ⊥⊥ D | A ∪ B and
A ⊥⊥ B | C ∪ D. There is no directed graph over four variables that implies the same
set of conditional independence properties.

The graphical framework can be extended in a consistent way to graphs that
include both directed and undirected links. These are called chain graphs (Lauritzen
and Wermuth, 1989; Frydenberg, 1990), and contain the directed and undirected
graphs considered so far as special cases. Although such graphs can represent a
broader class of distributions than either directed or undirected alone, there remain
distributions for which even a chain graph cannot provide a perfect map. Chain
graphs are not discussed further in this book.

Inference in Graphical Models

We turn now to the problem of inference in graphical models, in which some of
the nodes in a graph are clamped to observed values, and we wish to compute the
posterior distributions of one or more subsets of other nodes. As we shall see, we
can exploit the graphical structure both to ﬁnd efﬁcient algorithms for inference, and

to make the structure of those algorithms transparent. Speciﬁcally, we shall see that
many algorithms can be expressed in terms of the propagation of local messages
around the graph. In this section, we shall focus primarily on techniques for exact
inference, and in Chapter 10 we shall consider a number of approximate inference
algorithms.

To start with, let us consider the graphical interpretation of Bayes’ theorem.
Suppose we decompose the joint distribution p(x, y) over two variables x and y into
a product of factors in the form p(x, y) = p(x)p(y|x). This can be represented by
the directed graph shown in Figure 8.37(a). Now suppose we observe the value of
y, as indicated by the shaded node in Figure 8.37(b). We can view the marginal
distribution p(x) as a prior over the latent variable x, and our goal is to infer the
corresponding posterior distribution over x. Using the sum and product rules of
probability we can evaluate

(cid:2)

x(cid:1)

p(y) =

p(y|x

(cid:4))p(x
(cid:4))

(8.47)

which can then be used in Bayes’ theorem to calculate

p(x|y) = p(y|x)p(x)

.

(8.48)
Thus the joint distribution is now expressed in terms of p(y) and p(x|y). From a
graphical perspective, the joint distribution p(x, y) is now represented by the graph
shown in Figure 8.37(c), in which the direction of the arrow is reversed. This is the
simplest example of an inference problem for a graphical model.

p(y)

8.4.1 Inference on a chain
Now consider a more complex problem involving the chain of nodes of the form
shown in Figure 8.32. This example will lay the foundation for a discussion of exact
inference in more general graphs later in this section.

Speciﬁcally, we shall consider the undirected graph in Figure 8.32(b). We have
already seen that the directed chain can be transformed into an equivalent undirected
chain. Because the directed graph does not have any nodes with more than one
parent, this does not require the addition of any extra links, and the directed and
undirected versions of this graph express exactly the same set of conditional inde-
pendence statements.

8.4. Inference in Graphical Models

395

The joint distribution for this graph takes the form

p(x) =

1
Z

ψ1,2(x1, x2)ψ2,3(x2, x3)··· ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN).

(8.49)

We shall consider the speciﬁc case in which the N nodes represent discrete vari-
ables each having K states, in which case each potential function ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn)
comprises an K × K table, and so the joint distribution has (N − 1)K 2 parameters.
Let us consider the inference problem of ﬁnding the marginal distribution p(xn)
for a speciﬁc node xn that is part way along the chain. Note that, for the moment,
there are no observed nodes. By deﬁnition, the required marginal is obtained by
summing the joint distribution over all variables except xn, so that

In a naive implementation, we would ﬁrst evaluate the joint distribution and
then perform the summations explicitly. The joint distribution can be represented as
a set of numbers, one for each possible value for x. Because there are N variables
each with K states, there are K N values for x and so evaluation and storage of the
joint distribution, as well as marginalization to obtain p(xn), all involve storage and
computation that scale exponentially with the length N of the chain.

We can, however, obtain a much more efﬁcient algorithm by exploiting the con-
ditional independence properties of the graphical model. If we substitute the factor-
ized expression (8.49) for the joint distribution into (8.50), then we can rearrange the
order of the summations and the multiplications to allow the required marginal to be
evaluated much more efﬁciently. Consider for instance the summation over xN . The
potential ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN) is the only one that depends on xN , and so we can

perform the summation (cid:2)

ψN−1,N (xN−1, xN )

(8.51)

xN

ﬁrst to give a function of xN−1. We can then use this to perform the summation
over xN−1, which will involve only this new function together with the potential
ψN−2,N−1(xN−2, xN−1), because this is the only other place that xN−1 appears.
Similarly, the summation over x1 involves only the potential ψ1,2(x1, x2) and so
can be performed separately to give a function of x2, and so on. Because each
summation effectively removes a variable from the distribution, this can be viewed
as the removal of a node from the graph.

If we group the potentials and summations together in this way, we can express

396

(8.52)

The reader is encouraged to study this re-ordering carefully as the underlying idea
forms the basis for the later discussion of the general sum-product algorithm. Here
the key concept that we are exploiting is that multiplication is distributive over addi-
tion, so that

ab + ac = a(b + c)

(8.53)

in which the left-hand side involves three arithmetic operations whereas the right-
hand side reduces this to two operations.
Let us work out the computational cost of evaluating the required marginal using
this re-ordered expression. We have to perform N − 1 summations each of which is
over K states and each of which involves a function of two variables. For instance,
the summation over x1 involves only the function ψ1,2(x1, x2), which is a table of
K × K numbers. We have to sum this table over x1 for each value of x2 and so this
has O(K 2) cost. The resulting vector of K numbers is multiplied by the matrix of
numbers ψ2,3(x2, x3) and so is again O(K 2). Because there are N − 1 summations
and multiplications of this kind, the total cost of evaluating the marginal p(xn) is
O(N K 2). This is linear in the length of the chain, in contrast to the exponential cost
of a naive approach. We have therefore been able to exploit the many conditional
independence properties of this simple graph in order to obtain an efﬁcient calcula-
tion. If the graph had been fully connected, there would have been no conditional
independence properties, and we would have been forced to work directly with the
full joint distribution.

We now give a powerful interpretation of this calculation in terms of the passing
of local messages around on the graph. From (8.52) we see that the expression for the
marginal p(xn) decomposes into the product of two factors times the normalization
constant

p(xn) =

µα(xn)µβ(xn).

(8.54)

Z

We shall interpret µα(xn) as a message passed forwards along the chain from node
xn−1 to node xn. Similarly, µβ(xn) can be viewed as a message passed backwards

wards node xn.

along the chain to node xn from node xn+1. Note that each of the messages com-
prises a set of K values, one for each choice of xn, and so the product of two mes-
sages should be interpreted as the point-wise multiplication of the elements of the
two messages to give another set of K values.

The message µα(xn) can be evaluated recursively because

µα(xn) =

=

ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn)

xn−2

ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn)µα(xn−1).

(8.55)

We therefore ﬁrst evaluate

xn−1

µα(x2) =

(cid:2)

x1

ψ1,2(x1, x2)

(8.56)

and then apply (8.55) repeatedly until we reach the desired node. Note carefully the
structure of the message passing equation. The outgoing message µα(xn) in (8.55)
is obtained by multiplying the incoming message µα(xn−1) by the local potential
involving the node variable and the outgoing variable and then summing over the
node variable.

Similarly, the message µβ(xn) can be evaluated recursively by starting with

node xN and using

µβ(xn) =

=

(cid:2)

⎡⎣(cid:2)

···

ψn+1,n(xn+1, xn)

(8.57)

xn+1

This recursive message passing is illustrated in Figure 8.38. The normalization con-
stant Z is easily evaluated by summing the right-hand side of (8.54) over all states
of xn, an operation that requires only O(K) computation.

Graphs of the form shown in Figure 8.38 are called Markov chains, and the
corresponding message passing equations represent an example of the Chapman-
Kolmogorov equations for Markov processes (Papoulis, 1984).

398

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

Now suppose we wish to evaluate the marginals p(xn) for every node n ∈
{1, . . . , N} in the chain. Simply applying the above procedure separately for each
node will have computational cost that is O(N 2M 2). However, such an approach
would be very wasteful of computation. For instance, to ﬁnd p(x1) we need to prop-
agate a message µβ(·) from node xN back to node x2. Similarly, to evaluate p(x2)
we need to propagate a messages µβ(·) from node xN back to node x3. This will
involve much duplicated computation because most of the messages will be identical
in the two cases.

Suppose instead we ﬁrst launch a message µβ(xN−1) starting from node xN
and propagate corresponding messages all the way back to node x1, and suppose we
similarly launch a message µα(x2) starting from node x1 and propagate the corre-
sponding messages all the way forward to node xN . Provided we store all of the
intermediate messages along the way, then any node can evaluate its marginal sim-
ply by applying (8.54). The computational cost is only twice that for ﬁnding the
marginal of a single node, rather than N times as much. Observe that a message
has passed once in each direction across each link in the graph. Note also that the
normalization constant Z need be evaluated only once, using any convenient node.
If some of the nodes in the graph are observed, then the corresponding variables
are simply clamped to their observed values and there is no summation. To see

this, note that the effect of clamping a variable xn to an observed value (cid:1)xn can
additional function I(xn,(cid:1)xn), which takes the value 1 when xn =(cid:1)xn and the value
contain xn. Summations over xn then contain only one term in which xn =(cid:1)xn.

0 otherwise. One such function can then be absorbed into each of the potentials that

be expressed by multiplying the joint distribution by (one or more copies of) an

Now suppose we wish to calculate the joint distribution p(xn−1, xn) for two
neighbouring nodes on the chain. This is similar to the evaluation of the marginal
for a single node, except that there are now two variables that are not summed out.
A few moments thought will show that the required joint distribution can be written
in the form

p(xn−1, xn) =

1
Z

µα(xn−1)ψn−1,n(xn−1, xn)µβ(xn).

(8.58)

Thus we can obtain the joint distributions over all of the sets of variables in each
of the potentials directly once we have completed the message passing required to
obtain the marginals.

This is a useful result because in practice we may wish to use parametric forms
for the clique potentials, or equivalently for the conditional distributions if we started
from a directed graph. In order to learn the parameters of these potentials in situa-
tions where not all of the variables are observed, we can employ the EM algorithm,
and it turns out that the local joint distributions of the cliques, conditioned on any
observed data, is precisely what is needed in the E step. We shall consider some
examples of this in detail in Chapter 13.

8.4.2 Trees
We have seen that exact inference on a graph comprising a chain of nodes can be
performed efﬁciently in time that is linear in the number of nodes, using an algorithm

that can be interpreted in terms of messages passed along the chain. More generally,
inference can be performed efﬁciently using local message passing on a broader
class of graphs called trees. In particular, we shall shortly generalize the message
passing formalism derived above for chains to give the sum-product algorithm, which
provides an efﬁcient framework for exact inference in tree-structured graphs.

In the case of an undirected graph, a tree is deﬁned as a graph in which there
is one, and only one, path between any pair of nodes. Such graphs therefore do not
have loops. In the case of directed graphs, a tree is deﬁned such that there is a single
node, called the root, which has no parents, and all other nodes have one parent. If
we convert a directed tree into an undirected graph, we see that the moralization step
will not add any links as all nodes have at most one parent, and as a consequence the
corresponding moralized graph will be an undirected tree. Examples of undirected
and directed trees are shown in Figure 8.39(a) and 8.39(b). Note that a distribution
represented as a directed tree can easily be converted into one represented by an
undirected tree, and vice versa.

If there are nodes in a directed graph that have more than one parent, but there is
still only one path (ignoring the direction of the arrows) between any two nodes, then
the graph is a called a polytree, as illustrated in Figure 8.39(c). Such a graph will
have more than one node with the property of having no parents, and furthermore,
the corresponding moralized undirected graph will have loops.

8.4.3 Factor graphs
The sum-product algorithm that we derive in the next section is applicable to
undirected and directed trees and to polytrees. It can be cast in a particularly simple
and general form if we ﬁrst introduce a new graphical construction called a factor
graph (Frey, 1998; Kschischnang et al., 2001).

Exercise 8.18

Both directed and undirected graphs allow a global function of several vari-
ables to be expressed as a product of factors over subsets of those variables. Factor
graphs make this decomposition explicit by introducing additional nodes for the fac-
tors themselves in addition to the nodes representing the variables. They also allow
us to be more explicit about the details of the factorization, as we shall see.

Let us write the joint distribution over a set of variables in the form of a product

(cid:14)

of factors

p(x) =

fs(xs)

(8.59)

where xs denotes a subset of the variables. For convenience, we shall denote the

individual variables by xi, however, as in earlier discussions, these can comprise
groups of variables (such as vectors or matrices). Each factor fs is a function of a
corresponding set of variables xs.

Directed graphs, whose factorization is deﬁned by (8.5), represent special cases
of (8.59) in which the factors fs(xs) are local conditional distributions. Similarly,
undirected graphs, given by (8.39), are a special case in which the factors are po-
tential functions over the maximal cliques (the normalizing coefﬁcient 1/Z can be
viewed as a factor deﬁned over the empty set of variables).

In a factor graph, there is a node (depicted as usual by a circle) for every variable
in the distribution, as was the case for directed and undirected graphs. There are also
additional nodes (depicted by small squares) for each factor fs(xs) in the joint dis-
tribution. Finally, there are undirected links connecting each factor node to all of the
variables nodes on which that factor depends. Consider, for example, a distribution
that is expressed in terms of the factorization

p(x) = fa(x1, x2)fb(x1, x2)fc(x2, x3)fd(x3).

(8.60)

This can be expressed by the factor graph shown in Figure 8.40. Note that there are
two factors fa(x1, x2) and fb(x1, x2) that are deﬁned over the same set of variables.
In an undirected graph, the product of two such factors would simply be lumped
together into the same clique potential. Similarly, fc(x2, x3) and fd(x3) could be
combined into a single potential over x2 and x3. The factor graph, however, keeps
such factors explicit and so is able to convey more detailed information about the
underlying factorization.

Factor graphs are said to be bipartite because they consist of two distinct kinds
of nodes, and all links go between nodes of opposite type. In general, factor graphs
can therefore always be drawn as two rows of nodes (variable nodes at the top and
factor nodes at the bottom) with links between the rows, as shown in the example in
Figure 8.40. In some situations, however, other ways of laying out the graph may
be more intuitive, for example when the factor graph is derived from a directed or
undirected graph, as we shall see.

If we are given a distribution that is expressed in terms of an undirected graph,
then we can readily convert it to a factor graph. To do this, we create variable nodes
corresponding to the nodes in the original undirected graph, and then create addi-
tional factor nodes corresponding to the maximal cliques xs. The factors fs(xs) are
then set equal to the clique potentials. Note that there may be several different factor
graphs that correspond to the same undirected graph. These concepts are illustrated
in Figure 8.41.

Similarly, to convert a directed graph to a factor graph, we simply create variable
nodes in the factor graph corresponding to the nodes of the directed graph, and then
create factor nodes corresponding to the conditional distributions, and then ﬁnally
add the appropriate links. Again, there can be multiple factor graphs all of which
correspond to the same directed graph. The conversion of a directed graph to a
factor graph is illustrated in Figure 8.42.

We have already noted the importance of tree-structured graphs for performing
efﬁcient inference. If we take a directed or undirected tree and convert it into a factor
graph, then the result will again be a tree (in other words, the factor graph will have
no loops, and there will be one and only one path connecting any two nodes). In
the case of a directed polytree, conversion to an undirected graph results in loops
due to the moralization step, whereas conversion to a factor graph again results in a
tree, as illustrated in Figure 8.43.
In fact, local cycles in a directed graph due to
links connecting parents of a node can be removed on conversion to a factor graph
by deﬁning the appropriate factor function, as shown in Figure 8.44.

We have seen that multiple different factor graphs can represent the same di-
rected or undirected graph. This allows factor graphs to be more speciﬁc about the

precise form of the factorization. Figure 8.45 shows an example of a fully connected
undirected graph along with two different factor graphs.
In (b), the joint distri-
bution is given by a general form p(x) = f(x1, x2, x3), whereas in (c), it is given
by the more speciﬁc factorization p(x) = fa(x1, x2)fb(x1, x3)fc(x2, x3). It should
be emphasized that the factorization in (c) does not correspond to any conditional
independence properties.

8.4.4 The sum-product algorithm
We shall now make use of the factor graph framework to derive a powerful class
of efﬁcient, exact inference algorithms that are applicable to tree-structured graphs.
Here we shall focus on the problem of evaluating local marginals over nodes or
subsets of nodes, which will lead us to the sum-product algorithm. Later we shall
modify the technique to allow the most probable state to be found, giving rise to the
max-sum algorithm.

Also we shall suppose that all of the variables in the model are discrete, and
so marginalization corresponds to performing sums. The framework, however, is
equally applicable to linear-Gaussian models in which case marginalization involves
integration, and we shall consider an example of this in detail when we discuss linear
dynamical systems.

There is an algorithm for exact inference on directed graphs without loops known
as belief propagation (Pearl, 1988; Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988), and is equiv-
alent to a special case of the sum-product algorithm. Here we shall consider only the
sum-product algorithm because it is simpler to derive and to apply, as well as being
more general.

We shall assume that the original graph is an undirected tree or a directed tree or
polytree, so that the corresponding factor graph has a tree structure. We ﬁrst convert
the original graph into a factor graph so that we can deal with both directed and
undirected models using the same framework. Our goal is to exploit the structure of
the graph to achieve two things: (i) to obtain an efﬁcient, exact inference algorithm
for ﬁnding marginals; (ii) in situations where several marginals are required to allow
computations to be shared efﬁciently.

We begin by considering the problem of ﬁnding the marginal p(x) for partic-
ular variable node x. For the moment, we shall suppose that all of the variables
are hidden. Later we shall see how to modify the algorithm to incorporate evidence
corresponding to observed variables. By deﬁnition, the marginal is obtained by sum-
ming the joint distribution over all variables except x so that

p(x) =

p(x)

(8.61)

(cid:2)

where x \ x denotes the set of variables in x with variable x omitted. The idea is
to substitute for p(x) using the factor graph expression (8.59) and then interchange
summations and products in order to obtain an efﬁcient algorithm. Consider the
fragment of graph shown in Figure 8.46 in which we see that the tree structure of
the graph allows us to partition the factors in the joint distribution into groups, with
one group associated with each of the factor nodes that is a neighbour of the variable
node x. We see that the joint distribution can be written as a product of the form

p(x) =

Fs(x, Xs)

Here we have introduced a set of functions µfs→x(x), deﬁned by

which can be viewed as messages from the factor nodes fs to the variable node x.
We see that the required marginal p(x) is given by the product of all the incoming
messages arriving at node x.

In order to evaluate these messages, we again turn to Figure 8.46 and note that
each factor Fs(x, Xs) is described by a factor (sub-)graph and so can itself be fac-
torized. In particular, we can write

Fs(x, Xs) = fs(x, x1, . . . , xM )G1 (x1, Xs1) . . . GM (xM , XsM )

(8.65)

where, for convenience, we have denoted the variables associated with factor fx, in
addition to x, by x1, . . . , xM . This factorization is illustrated in Figure 8.47. Note
that the set of variables {x, x1, . . . , xM} is the set of variables on which the factor
 
fs depends, and so it can also be denoted xs, using the notation of (8.59).

We have therefore introduced two distinct kinds of message, those that go from factor
nodes to variable nodes denoted µf→x(x), and those that go from variable nodes to
factor nodes denoted µx→f (x). In each case, we see that messages passed along a
link are always a function of the variable associated with the variable node that link
connects to.

The result (8.66) says that to evaluate the message sent by a factor node to a vari-
able node along the link connecting them, take the product of the incoming messages
along all other links coming into the factor node, multiply by the factor associated
with that node, and then marginalize over all of the variables associated with the
incoming messages. This is illustrated in Figure 8.47. It is important to note that
a factor node can send a message to a variable node once it has received incoming
messages from all other neighbouring variable nodes.

Finally, we derive an expression for evaluating the messages from variable nodes
to factor nodes, again by making use of the (sub-)graph factorization. From Fig-
ure 8.48, we see that term Gm(xm, Xsm) associated with node xm is given by a
product of terms Fl(xm, Xml) each associated with one of the factor nodes fl that is
linked to node xm (excluding node fs), so that

(8.68)

where the product is taken over all neighbours of node xm except for node fs. Note
that each of the factors Fl(xm, Xml) represents a subtree of the original graph of
precisely the same kind as introduced in (8.62). Substituting (8.68) into (8.67), we

where we have used the deﬁnition (8.64) of the messages passed from factor nodes to
variable nodes. Thus to evaluate the message sent by a variable node to an adjacent
factor node along the connecting link, we simply take the product of the incoming
messages along all of the other links. Note that any variable node that has only
two neighbours performs no computation but simply passes messages through un-
changed. Also, we note that a variable node can send a message to a factor node
once it has received incoming messages from all other neighbouring factor nodes.

Recall that our goal is to calculate the marginal for variable node x, and that this
marginal is given by the product of incoming messages along all of the links arriving
at that node. Each of these messages can be computed recursively in terms of other
messages. In order to start this recursion, we can view the node x as the root of the
tree and begin at the leaf nodes. From the deﬁnition (8.69), we see that if a leaf node
is a variable node, then the message that it sends along its one and only link is given
by

(8.70)
as illustrated in Figure 8.49(a). Similarly, if the leaf node is a factor node, we see
from (8.66) that the message sent should take the form

µx→f (x) = 1

µf→x(x) = f(x)

(8.71)

pend on whether the leaf

as illustrated in Figure 8.49(b).

At this point, it is worth pausing to summarize the particular version of the sum-
product algorithm obtained so far for evaluating the marginal p(x). We start by
viewing the variable node x as the root of the factor graph and initiating messages
at the leaves of the graph using (8.70) and (8.71). The message passing steps (8.66)
and (8.69) are then applied recursively until messages have been propagated along
every link, and the root node has received messages from all of its neighbours. Each
node can send a message towards the root once it has received messages from all
of its other neighbours. Once the root node has received messages from all of its
neighbours, the required marginal can be evaluated using (8.63). We shall illustrate
this process shortly.

To see that each node will always receive enough messages to be able to send out
a message, we can use a simple inductive argument as follows. Clearly, for a graph
comprising a variable root node connected directly to several factor leaf nodes, the
algorithm trivially involves sending messages of the form (8.71) directly from the
leaves to the root. Now imagine building up a general graph by adding nodes one at
a time, and suppose that for some particular graph we have a valid algorithm. When
one more (variable or factor) node is added, it can be connected only by a single
link because the overall graph must remain a tree, and so the new node will be a leaf
node. It therefore sends a message to the node to which it is linked, which in turn
will therefore receive all the messages it requires in order to send its own message
towards the root, and so again we have a valid algorithm, thereby completing the
proof.

Now suppose we wish to ﬁnd the marginals for every variable node in the graph.
This could be done by simply running the above algorithm afresh for each such node.
However, this would be very wasteful as many of the required computations would
be repeated. We can obtain a much more efﬁcient procedure by ‘overlaying’ these
multiple message passing algorithms to obtain the general sum-product algorithm
as follows. Arbitrarily pick any (variable or factor) node and designate it as the
root. Propagate messages from the leaves to the root as before. At this point, the
root node will have received messages from all of its neighbours. It can therefore
send out messages to all of its neighbours. These in turn will then have received
messages from all of their neighbours and so can send out messages along the links
going away from the root, and so on. In this way, messages are passed outwards
from the root all the way to the leaves. By now, a message will have passed in
both directions across every link in the graph, and every node will have received
a message from all of its neighbours. Again a simple inductive argument can be
used to verify the validity of this message passing protocol. Because every variable
node will have received messages from all of its neighbours, we can readily calculate
the marginal distribution for every variable in the graph. The number of messages
that have to be computed is given by twice the number of links in the graph and
so involves only twice the computation involved in ﬁnding a single marginal. By
comparison, if we had run the sum-product algorithm separately for each node, the
amount of computation would grow quadratically with the size of the graph. Note
that this algorithm is in fact independent of which node was designated as the root,

Exercise 8.20

Figure 8.50 The sum-product algorithm can be viewed
purely in terms of messages sent out by factor
nodes to other factor nodes.
In this example,
the outgoing message shown by the blue arrow
is obtained by taking the product of all the in-
coming messages shown by green arrows, mul-
tiplying by the factor fs, and marginalizing over
the variables x1 and x2.

and indeed the notion of one node having a special status was introduced only as a
convenient way to explain the message passing protocol.

Next suppose we wish to ﬁnd the marginal distributions p(xs) associated with
the sets of variables belonging to each of the factors. By a similar argument to that
used above, it is easy to see that the marginal associated with a factor is given by the
product of messages arriving at the factor node and the local factor at that node

p(xs) = fs(xs)

µxi→fs(xi)

(8.72)

(cid:14)

i∈ne(fs)

in complete analogy with the marginals at the variable nodes.
If the factors are
parameterized functions and we wish to learn the values of the parameters using
the EM algorithm, then these marginals are precisely the quantities we will need to
calculate in the E step, as we shall see in detail when we discuss the hidden Markov
model in Chapter 13.

The message sent by a variable node to a factor node, as we have seen, is simply
the product of the incoming messages on other links. We can if we wish view the
sum-product algorithm in a slightly different form by eliminating messages from
variable nodes to factor nodes and simply considering messages that are sent out by
factor nodes. This is most easily seen by considering the example in Figure 8.50.

So far, we have rather neglected the issue of normalization. If the factor graph
was derived from a directed graph, then the joint distribution is already correctly nor-
malized, and so the marginals obtained by the sum-product algorithm will similarly
be normalized correctly. However, if we started from an undirected graph, then in
general there will be an unknown normalization coefﬁcient 1/Z. As with the simple
chain example of Figure 8.38, this is easily handled by working with an unnormal-

ized version(cid:4)p(x) of the joint distribution, where p(x) =(cid:4)p(x)/Z. We ﬁrst run the
sum-product algorithm to ﬁnd the corresponding unnormalized marginals(cid:4)p(xi). The
(cid:4)p(x) directly.

coefﬁcient 1/Z is then easily obtained by normalizing any one of these marginals,
and this is computationally efﬁcient because the normalization is done over a single
variable rather than over the entire set of variables as would be required to normalize

At this point, it may be helpful to consider a simple example to illustrate the
operation of the sum-product algorithm. Figure 8.51 shows a simple 4-node factor

In order to apply the sum-product algorithm to this graph, let us designate node x3
as the root, in which case there are two leaf nodes x1 and x4. Starting with the leaf
nodes, we then have the following sequence of six messages

One message has now passed in each direction across each link, and we can now
evaluate the marginals. As a simple check, let us verify that the marginal p(x2) is
given by the correct expression. Using (8.63) and substituting for the messages using
the above results, we have

So far, we have assumed that all of the variables in the graph are hidden. In most
practical applications, a subset of the variables will be observed, and we wish to cal-
culate posterior distributions conditioned on these observations. Observed nodes are
easily handled within the sum-product algorithm as follows. Suppose we partition x
into hidden variables h and observed variables v, and that the observed value of v

(cid:21)
is denoted(cid:1)v. Then we simply multiply the joint distribution p(x) by
i I(vi,(cid:1)vi),
where I(v,(cid:1)v) = 1 if v =(cid:1)v and I(v,(cid:1)v) = 0 otherwise. This product corresponds
to p(h, v = (cid:1)v) and hence is an unnormalized version of p(h|v = (cid:1)v). By run-
p(hi|v =(cid:1)v) up to a normalization coefﬁcient whose value can be found efﬁciently

ning the sum-product algorithm, we can efﬁciently calculate the posterior marginals

using a local computation. Any summations over variables in v then collapse into a
single term.

We have assumed throughout this section that we are dealing with discrete vari-
ables. However, there is nothing speciﬁc to discrete variables either in the graphical
framework or in the probabilistic construction of the sum-product algorithm. For

continuous variables the summations are simply replaced by integrations. We shall
give an example of the sum-product algorithm applied to a graph of linear-Gaussian
variables when we consider linear dynamical systems.

8.4.5 The max-sum algorithm
The sum-product algorithm allows us to take a joint distribution p(x) expressed
as a factor graph and efﬁciently ﬁnd marginals over the component variables. Two
other common tasks are to ﬁnd a setting of the variables that has the largest prob-
ability and to ﬁnd the value of that probability. These can be addressed through a
closely related algorithm called max-sum, which can be viewed as an application of
dynamic programming in the context of graphical models (Cormen et al., 2001).

A simple approach to ﬁnding latent variable values having high probability
would be to run the sum-product algorithm to obtain the marginals p(xi) for ev-
ery variable, and then, for each marginal in turn, to ﬁnd the value x(cid:1)
i that maximizes
that marginal. However, this would give the set of values that are individually the
most probable. In practice, we typically wish to ﬁnd the set of values that jointly
have the largest probability, in other words the vector xmax that maximizes the joint
distribution, so that

xmax = arg max

p(x)

for which the corresponding value of the joint probability will be given by

p(xmax) = max

x

p(x).

x

(8.87)

(8.88)

In general, xmax is not the same as the set of x(cid:1)
i values, as we can easily show using
a simple example. Consider the joint distribution p(x, y) over two binary variables
x, y ∈ {0, 1} given in Table 8.1. The joint distribution is maximized by setting x =
1 and y = 0, corresponding the value 0.4. However, the marginal for p(x), obtained
by summing over both values of y, is given by p(x = 0) = 0.6 and p(x = 1) = 0.4,
and similarly the marginal for y is given by p(y = 0) = 0.7 and p(y = 1) = 0.3,
and so the marginals are maximized by x = 0 and y = 0, which corresponds to a
value of 0.3 for the joint distribution. In fact, it is not difﬁcult to construct examples
for which the set of individually most probable values has probability zero under the
joint distribution.

We therefore seek an efﬁcient algorithm for ﬁnding the value of x that maxi-
mizes the joint distribution p(x) and that will allow us to obtain the value of the
joint distribution at its maximum. To address the second of these problems, we shall
simply write out the max operator in terms of its components

(8.89)

Exercise 8.27

412

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

where M is the total number of variables, and then substitute for p(x) using its
expansion in terms of a product of factors. In deriving the sum-product algorithm,
we made use of the distributive law (8.53) for multiplication. Here we make use of
the analogous law for the max operator

(8.90)
which holds if a (cid:2) 0 (as will always be the case for the factors in a graphical model).
This allows us to exchange products with maximizations.

max(ab, ac) = a max(b, c)

Consider ﬁrst the simple example of a chain of nodes described by (8.49). The

evaluation of the probability maximum can be written as

.

xN

(cid:30)(cid:30)

As with the calculation of marginals, we see that exchanging the max and product
operators results in a much more efﬁcient computation, and one that is easily inter-
preted in terms of messages passed from node xN backwards along the chain to node
x1.

We can readily generalize this result to arbitrary tree-structured factor graphs
by substituting the expression (8.59) for the factor graph expansion into (8.89) and
again exchanging maximizations with products. The structure of this calculation is
identical to that of the sum-product algorithm, and so we can simply translate those
results into the present context. In particular, suppose that we designate a particular
variable node as the ‘root’ of the graph. Then we start a set of messages propagating
inwards from the leaves of the tree towards the root, with each node sending its
message towards the root once it has received all incoming messages from its other
neighbours. The ﬁnal maximization is performed over the product of all messages
arriving at the root node, and gives the maximum value for p(x). This could be called
the max-product algorithm and is identical to the sum-product algorithm except that
summations are replaced by maximizations. Note that at this stage, messages have
been sent from leaves to the root, but not in the other direction.

In practice, products of many small probabilities can lead to numerical under-
ﬂow problems, and so it is convenient to work with the logarithm of the joint distri-
bution. The logarithm is a monotonic function, so that if a > b then ln a > ln b, and
hence the max operator and the logarithm function can be interchanged, so that

(cid:17)

(cid:18)

p(x)

= max

ln p(x).

The distributive property is preserved because

max(a + b, a + c) = a + max(b, c).

(8.91)

(8.92)

Thus taking the logarithm simply has the effect of replacing the products in the
max-product algorithm with sums, and so we obtain the max-sum algorithm. From

8.4. Inference in Graphical Models

413

the results (8.66) and (8.69) derived earlier for the sum-product algorithm, we can
readily write down the max-sum algorithm in terms of message passing simply by
replacing ‘sum’ with ‘max’ and replacing products with sums of logarithms to give

while at the root node the maximum probability can then be computed, by analogy
with (8.63), using

So far, we have seen how to ﬁnd the maximum of the joint distribution by prop-
agating messages from the leaves to an arbitrarily chosen root node. The result will
be the same irrespective of which node is chosen as the root. Now we turn to the
second problem of ﬁnding the conﬁguration of the variables for which the joint dis-
tribution attains this maximum value. So far, we have sent messages from the leaves
to the root. The process of evaluating (8.97) will also give the value xmax for the
most probable value of the root node variable, deﬁned by

xmax = arg max

x

µfs→x(x)

(8.98)

At this point, we might be tempted simply to continue with the message passing al-
gorithm and send messages from the root back out to the leaves, using (8.93) and
(8.94), then apply (8.98) to all of the remaining variable nodes. However, because
we are now maximizing rather than summing, it is possible that there may be mul-
tiple conﬁgurations of x all of which give rise to the maximum value for p(x). In
such cases, this strategy can fail because it is possible for the individual variable
values obtained by maximizing the product of messages at each node to belong to
different maximizing conﬁgurations, giving an overall conﬁguration that no longer
corresponds to a maximum.

The problem can be resolved by adopting a rather different kind of message
passing from the root node to the leaves. To see how this works, let us return once
again to the simple chain example of N variables x1, . . . , xN each having K states,

ables in terms of a lattice or trellis diagram as shown in Figure 8.53. Note that this
is not a probabilistic graphical model because the nodes represent individual states
of variables, while each variable corresponds to a column of such states in the di-
agram. For each state of a given variable, there is a unique state of the previous
variable that maximizes the probability (ties are broken either systematically or at
random), corresponding to the function φ(xn) given by (8.101), and this is indicated

8.4. Inference in Graphical Models

by the lines connecting the nodes. Once we know the most probable value of the ﬁ-
nal node xN , we can then simply follow the link back to ﬁnd the most probable state
of node xN−1 and so on back to the initial node x1. This corresponds to propagating
a message back down the chain using

n−1 = φ(xmax
xmax
n )

(8.102)

and is known as back-tracking. Note that there could be several values of xn−1 all
of which give the maximum value in (8.101). Provided we chose one of these values
when we do the back-tracking, we are assured of a globally consistent maximizing
conﬁguration.

In Figure 8.53, we have indicated two paths, each of which we shall suppose
corresponds to a global maximum of the joint probability distribution. If k = 2
and k = 3 each represent possible values of xmax
N , then starting from either state
and tracing back along the black lines, which corresponds to iterating (8.102), we
obtain a valid global maximum conﬁguration. Note that if we had run a forward
pass of max-sum message passing followed by a backward pass and then applied
(8.98) at each node separately, we could end up selecting some states from one path
and some from the other path, giving an overall conﬁguration that is not a global
maximizer. We see that it is necessary instead to keep track of the maximizing states
during the forward pass using the functions φ(xn) and then use back-tracking to ﬁnd
a consistent solution.

The extension to a general tree-structured factor graph should now be clear. If
a message is sent from a factor node f to a variable node x, a maximization is
performed over all other variable nodes x1, . . . , xM that are neighbours of that fac-
tor node, using (8.93). When we perform this maximization, we keep a record of
which values of the variables x1, . . . , xM gave rise to the maximum. Then in the
back-tracking step, having found xmax, we can then use these stored values to as-
sign consistent maximizing states xmax
M . The max-sum algorithm, with
back-tracking, gives an exact maximizing conﬁguration for the variables provided
the factor graph is a tree. An important application of this technique is for ﬁnding
the most probable sequence of hidden states in a hidden Markov model, in which
case it is known as the Viterbi algorithm.

, . . . , xmax

As with the sum-product algorithm, the inclusion of evidence in the form of
observed variables is straightforward. The observed variables are clamped to their
observed values, and the maximization is performed over the remaining hidden vari-
ables. This can be shown formally by including identity functions for the observed
variables into the factor functions, as we did for the sum-product algorithm.

It is interesting to compare max-sum with the iterated conditional modes (ICM)
algorithm described on page 389. Each step in ICM is computationally simpler be-
cause the ‘messages’ that are passed from one node to the next comprise a single
value consisting of the new state of the node for which the conditional distribution
is maximized. The max-sum algorithm is more complex because the messages are
functions of node variables x and hence comprise a set of K values for each pos-
sible state of x. Unlike max-sum, however, ICM is not guaranteed to ﬁnd a global
maximum even for tree-structured graphs.

8.4.6 Exact inference in general graphs
The sum-product and max-sum algorithms provide efﬁcient and exact solutions
to inference problems in tree-structured graphs. For many practical applications,
however, we have to deal with graphs having loops.

The message passing framework can be generalized to arbitrary graph topolo-
gies, giving an exact inference procedure known as the junction tree algorithm (Lau-
ritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988; Jordan, 2007). Here we give a brief outline of the
key steps involved. This is not intended to convey a detailed understanding of the
algorithm, but rather to give a ﬂavour of the various stages involved. If the starting
point is a directed graph, it is ﬁrst converted to an undirected graph by moraliza-
tion, whereas if starting from an undirected graph this step is not required. Next the
graph is triangulated, which involves ﬁnding chord-less cycles containing four or
more nodes and adding extra links to eliminate such chord-less cycles. For instance,
in the graph in Figure 8.36, the cycle A–C–B–D–A is chord-less a link could be
added between A and B or alternatively between C and D. Note that the joint dis-
tribution for the resulting triangulated graph is still deﬁned by a product of the same
potential functions, but these are now considered to be functions over expanded sets
of variables. Next the triangulated graph is used to construct a new tree-structured
undirected graph called a join tree, whose nodes correspond to the maximal cliques
of the triangulated graph, and whose links connect pairs of cliques that have vari-
ables in common. The selection of which pairs of cliques to connect in this way is
important and is done so as to give a maximal spanning tree deﬁned as follows. Of
all possible trees that link up the cliques, the one that is chosen is one for which the
weight of the tree is largest, where the weight for a link is the number of nodes shared
by the two cliques it connects, and the weight for the tree is the sum of the weights
for the links. If the tree is condensed, so that any clique that is a subset of another
clique is absorbed into the larger clique, this gives a junction tree. As a consequence
of the triangulation step, the resulting tree satisﬁes the running intersection property,
which means that if a variable is contained in two cliques, then it must also be con-
tained in every clique on the path that connects them. This ensures that inference
about variables will be consistent across the graph. Finally, a two-stage message
passing algorithm, essentially equivalent to the sum-product algorithm, can now be
applied to this junction tree in order to ﬁnd marginals and conditionals. Although
the junction tree algorithm sounds complicated, at its heart is the simple idea that
we have used already of exploiting the factorization properties of the distribution to
allow sums and products to be interchanged so that partial summations can be per-
formed, thereby avoiding having to work directly with the joint distribution. The
role of the junction tree is to provide a precise and efﬁcient way to organize these
computations. It is worth emphasizing that this is achieved using purely graphical
operations!

The junction tree is exact for arbitrary graphs and is efﬁcient in the sense that
for a given graph there does not in general exist a computationally cheaper approach.
Unfortunately, the algorithm must work with the joint distributions within each node
(each of which corresponds to a clique of the triangulated graph) and so the compu-
tational cost of the algorithm is determined by the number of variables in the largest

8.4. Inference in Graphical Models

417

clique and will grow exponentially with this number in the case of discrete variables.
An important concept is the treewidth of a graph (Bodlaender, 1993), which is de-
ﬁned in terms of the number of variables in the largest clique. In fact, it is deﬁned to
be as one less than the size of the largest clique, to ensure that a tree has a treewidth
of 1. Because there in general there can be multiple different junction trees that can
be constructed from a given starting graph, the treewidth is deﬁned by the junction
tree for which the largest clique has the fewest variables.
If the treewidth of the
original graph is high, the junction tree algorithm becomes impractical.

8.4.7 Loopy belief propagation
For many problems of practical interest, it will not be feasible to use exact in-
ference, and so we need to exploit effective approximation methods. An important
class of such approximations, that can broadly be called variational methods, will be
discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Complementing these deterministic approaches is
a wide range of sampling methods, also called Monte Carlo methods, that are based
on stochastic numerical sampling from distributions and that will be discussed at
length in Chapter 11.

Here we consider one simple approach to approximate inference in graphs with
loops, which builds directly on the previous discussion of exact inference in trees.
The idea is simply to apply the sum-product algorithm even though there is no guar-
antee that it will yield good results. This approach is known as loopy belief propa-
gation (Frey and MacKay, 1998) and is possible because the message passing rules
(8.66) and (8.69) for the sum-product algorithm are purely local. However, because
the graph now has cycles, information can ﬂow many times around the graph. For
some models, the algorithm will converge, whereas for others it will not.

In order to apply this approach, we need to deﬁne a message passing schedule.
Let us assume that one message is passed at a time on any given link and in any
given direction. Each message sent from a node replaces any previous message sent
in the same direction across the same link and will itself be a function only of the
most recent messages received by that node at previous steps of the algorithm.

We have seen that a message can only be sent across a link from a node when
all other messages have been received by that node across its other links. Because
there are loops in the graph, this raises the problem of how to initiate the message
passing algorithm. To resolve this, we suppose that an initial message given by the
unit function has been passed across every link in each direction. Every node is then
in a position to send a message.

There are now many possible ways to organize the message passing schedule.
For example, the ﬂooding schedule simultaneously passes a message across every
link in both directions at each time step, whereas schedules that pass one message at
a time are called serial schedules.

Following Kschischnang et al. (2001), we will say that a (variable or factor)
node a has a message pending on its link to a node b if node a has received any
message on any of its other links since the last time it send a message to b. Thus,
when a node receives a message on one of its links, this creates pending messages
on all of its other links. Only pending messages need to be transmitted because

418

8. GRAPHICAL MODELS

Exercise 8.29

other messages would simply duplicate the previous message on the same link. For
graphs that have a tree structure, any schedule that sends only pending messages
will eventually terminate once a message has passed in each direction across every
link. At this point, there are no pending messages, and the product of the received
messages at every variable give the exact marginal. In graphs having loops, however,
the algorithm may never terminate because there might always be pending messages,
although in practice it is generally found to converge within a reasonable time for
most applications. Once the algorithm has converged, or once it has been stopped
if convergence is not observed, the (approximate) local marginals can be computed
using the product of the most recently received incoming messages to each variable
node or factor node on every link.

In some applications, the loopy belief propagation algorithm can give poor re-
sults, whereas in other applications it has proven to be very effective. In particular,
state-of-the-art algorithms for decoding certain kinds of error-correcting codes are
equivalent to loopy belief propagation (Gallager, 1963; Berrou et al., 1993; McEliece
et al., 1998; MacKay and Neal, 1999; Frey, 1998).

8.4.8 Learning the graph structure
In our discussion of inference in graphical models, we have assumed that the
structure of the graph is known and ﬁxed. However, there is also interest in go-
ing beyond the inference problem and learning the graph structure itself from data
(Friedman and Koller, 2003). This requires that we deﬁne a space of possible struc-
tures as well as a measure that can be used to score each structure.

From a Bayesian viewpoint, we would ideally like to compute a posterior dis-
tribution over graph structures and to make predictions by averaging with respect
to this distribution. If we have a prior p(m) over graphs indexed by m, then the
posterior distribution is given by

p(m|D) ∝ p(m)p(D|m)

(8.103)
where D is the observed data set. The model evidence p(D|m) then provides the
score for each model. However, evaluation of the evidence involves marginalization
over the latent variables and presents a challenging computational problem for many
models.

Exploring the space of structures can also be problematic. Because the number
of different graph structures grows exponentially with the number of nodes, it is
often necessary to resort to heuristics to ﬁnd good candidates.

Mixture Models

and EM

If we deﬁne a joint distribution over observed and latent variables, the correspond-
ing distribution of the observed variables alone is obtained by marginalization. This
allows relatively complex marginal distributions over observed variables to be ex-
pressed in terms of more tractable joint distributions over the expanded space of
observed and latent variables. The introduction of latent variables thereby allows
complicated distributions to be formed from simpler components. In this chapter,
we shall see that mixture distributions, such as the Gaussian mixture discussed in
Section 2.3.9, can be interpreted in terms of discrete latent variables. Continuous
latent variables will form the subject of Chapter 12.

As well as providing a framework for building more complex probability dis-
tributions, mixture models can also be used to cluster data. We therefore begin our
discussion of mixture distributions by considering the problem of ﬁnding clusters
in a set of data points, which we approach ﬁrst using a nonprobabilistic technique
called the K-means algorithm (Lloyd, 1982). Then we introduce the latent variable

9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM

Section 9.2

Section 9.4

view of mixture distributions in which the discrete latent variables can be interpreted
as deﬁning assignments of data points to speciﬁc components of the mixture. A gen-
eral technique for ﬁnding maximum likelihood estimators in latent variable models
is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We ﬁrst of all use the Gaussian
mixture distribution to motivate the EM algorithm in a fairly informal way, and then
we give a more careful treatment based on the latent variable viewpoint. We shall
see that the K-means algorithm corresponds to a particular nonprobabilistic limit of
EM applied to mixtures of Gaussians. Finally, we discuss EM in some generality.

Gaussian mixture models are widely used in data mining, pattern recognition,
machine learning, and statistical analysis. In many applications, their parameters are
determined by maximum likelihood, typically using the EM algorithm. However, as
we shall see there are some signiﬁcant limitations to the maximum likelihood ap-
proach, and in Chapter 10 we shall show that an elegant Bayesian treatment can be
given using the framework of variational inference. This requires little additional
computation compared with EM, and it resolves the principal difﬁculties of maxi-
mum likelihood while also allowing the number of components in the mixture to be
inferred automatically from the data.

9.1. K-means Clustering

We begin by considering the problem of identifying groups, or clusters, of data points
in a multidimensional space. Suppose we have a data set {x1, . . . , xN} consisting
of N observations of a random D-dimensional Euclidean variable x. Our goal is to
partition the data set into some number K of clusters, where we shall suppose for
the moment that the value of K is given. Intuitively, we might think of a cluster as
comprising a group of data points whose inter-point distances are small compared
with the distances to points outside of the cluster. We can formalize this notion by
ﬁrst introducing a set of D-dimensional vectors µk, where k = 1, . . . , K, in which
µk is a prototype associated with the kth cluster. As we shall see shortly, we can
think of the µk as representing the centres of the clusters. Our goal is then to ﬁnd
an assignment of data points to clusters, as well as a set of vectors {µk}, such that
the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its closest vector µk, is
a minimum.

It is convenient at this point to deﬁne some notation to describe the assignment
of data points to clusters. For each data point xn, we introduce a corresponding set
of binary indicator variables rnk ∈ {0, 1}, where k = 1, . . . , K describing which of
the K clusters the data point xn is assigned to, so that if data point xn is assigned to
cluster k then rnk = 1, and rnj = 0 for j (cid:9)= k. This is known as the 1-of-K coding
scheme. We can then deﬁne an objective function, sometimes called a distortion
measure, given by

N(cid:2)

K(cid:2)

J =

rnk(cid:5)xn − µk(cid:5)2

(9.1)

which represents the sum of the squares of the distances of each data point to its

k=1

9.1. K-means Clustering

assigned vector µk. Our goal is to ﬁnd values for the {rnk} and the {µk} so as to
minimize J. We can do this through an iterative procedure in which each iteration
involves two successive steps corresponding to successive optimizations with respect
to the rnk and the µk. First we choose some initial values for the µk. Then in the ﬁrst
phase we minimize J with respect to the rnk, keeping the µk ﬁxed. In the second
phase we minimize J with respect to the µk, keeping rnk ﬁxed. This two-stage
optimization is then repeated until convergence. We shall see that these two stages
of updating rnk and updating µk correspond respectively to the E (expectation) and
M (maximization) steps of the EM algorithm, and to emphasize this we shall use the
terms E step and M step in the context of the K-means algorithm.

Section 9.4

Consider ﬁrst the determination of the rnk. Because J in (9.1) is a linear func-
tion of rnk, this optimization can be performed easily to give a closed form solution.
The terms involving different n are independent and so we can optimize for each
n separately by choosing rnk to be 1 for whichever value of k gives the minimum
value of (cid:5)xn − µk(cid:5)2. In other words, we simply assign the nth data point to the
closest cluster centre. More formally, this can be expressed as
if k = arg minj (cid:5)xn − µj(cid:5)2
otherwise.

rnk =

(cid:12)

(9.2)

0

Now consider the optimization of the µk with the rnk held ﬁxed. The objective
function J is a quadratic function of µk, and it can be minimized by setting its
derivative with respect to µk to zero giving

N(cid:2)

n=1

µk =

rnk(xn − µk) = 0
(cid:5)
n rnkxn(cid:5)

which we can easily solve for µk to give

(9.3)

(9.4)

The denominator in this expression is equal to the number of points assigned to
cluster k, and so this result has a simple interpretation, namely set µk equal to the
mean of all of the data points xn assigned to cluster k. For this reason, the procedure
is known as the K-means algorithm.

The two phases of re-assigning data points to clusters and re-computing the clus-
ter means are repeated in turn until there is no further change in the assignments (or
until some maximum number of iterations is exceeded). Because each phase reduces
the value of the objective function J, convergence of the algorithm is assured. How-
ever, it may converge to a local rather than global minimum of J. The convergence
properties of the K-means algorithm were studied by MacQueen (1967).

The K-means algorithm is illustrated using the Old Faithful data set in Fig-
ure 9.1. For the purposes of this example, we have made a linear re-scaling of the
data, known as standardizing, such that each of the variables has zero mean and
unit standard deviation. For this example, we have chosen K = 2, and so in this

by the red and blue crosses, respectively. (b) In the initial E step, each data point is assigned either to the red

case, the assignment of each data point to the nearest cluster centre is equivalent to a
classiﬁcation of the data points according to which side they lie of the perpendicular
bisector of the two cluster centres. A plot of the cost function J given by (9.1) for
the Old Faithful example is shown in Figure 9.2.

Note that we have deliberately chosen poor initial values for the cluster centres
so that the algorithm takes several steps before convergence. In practice, a better
initialization procedure would be to choose the cluster centres µk to be equal to a
random subset of K data points. It is also worth noting that the K-means algorithm
itself is often used to initialize the parameters in a Gaussian mixture model before
applying the EM algorithm.

A direct implementation of the K-means algorithm as discussed here can be
relatively slow, because in each E step it is necessary to compute the Euclidean dis-
tance between every prototype vector and every data point. Various schemes have
been proposed for speeding up the K-means algorithm, some of which are based on
precomputing a data structure such as a tree such that nearby points are in the same
subtree (Ramasubramanian and Paliwal, 1990; Moore, 2000). Other approaches
make use of the triangle inequality for distances, thereby avoiding unnecessary dis-
tance calculations (Hodgson, 1998; Elkan, 2003).

So far, we have considered a batch version of K-means in which the whole data
set is used together to update the prototype vectors. We can also derive an on-line
stochastic algorithm (MacQueen, 1967) by applying the Robbins-Monro procedure
to the problem of ﬁnding the roots of the regression function given by the derivatives
of J in (9.1) with respect to µk. This leads to a sequential update in which, for each
data point xn in turn, we update the nearest prototype µk using

(9.5)

µnew

k = µold

k + ηn(xn − µold
k )

where ηn is the learning rate parameter, which is typically made to decrease mono-
tonically as more data points are considered.

The K-means algorithm is based on the use of squared Euclidean distance as the
measure of dissimilarity between a data point and a prototype vector. Not only does
this limit the type of data variables that can be considered (it would be inappropriate
for cases where some or all of the variables represent categorical labels for instance),

428

9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM

Section 2.3.7

but it can also make the determination of the cluster means nonrobust to outliers. We
can generalize the K-means algorithm by introducing a more general dissimilarity
measure V(x, x(cid:4)) between two vectors x and x(cid:4)
and then minimizing the following
distortion measure

N(cid:2)

K(cid:2)

(cid:4)J =

rnkV(xn, µk)

(9.6)

n=1

k=1

which gives the K-medoids algorithm. The E step again involves, for given cluster
prototypes µk, assigning each data point to the cluster for which the dissimilarity to
the corresponding prototype is smallest. The computational cost of this is O(KN),
as is the case for the standard K-means algorithm. For a general choice of dissimi-
larity measure, the M step is potentially more complex than for K-means, and so it
is common to restrict each cluster prototype to be equal to one of the data vectors as-
signed to that cluster, as this allows the algorithm to be implemented for any choice
of dissimilarity measure V(·,·) so long as it can be readily evaluated. Thus the M
step involves, for each cluster k, a discrete search over the Nk points assigned to that
cluster, which requires O(N 2

k) evaluations of V(·,·).

One notable feature of the K-means algorithm is that at each iteration, every
data point is assigned uniquely to one, and only one, of the clusters. Whereas some
data points will be much closer to a particular centre µk than to any other centre,
there may be other data points that lie roughly midway between cluster centres. In
the latter case, it is not clear that the hard assignment to the nearest cluster is the
most appropriate. We shall see in the next section that by adopting a probabilistic
approach, we obtain ‘soft’ assignments of data points to clusters in a way that reﬂects
the level of uncertainty over the most appropriate assignment. This probabilistic
formulation brings with it numerous beneﬁts.

9.1.1 Image segmentation and compression
As an illustration of the application of the K-means algorithm, we consider
the related problems of image segmentation and image compression. The goal of
segmentation is to partition an image into regions each of which has a reasonably
homogeneous visual appearance or which corresponds to objects or parts of objects
(Forsyth and Ponce, 2003). Each pixel in an image is a point in a 3-dimensional space
comprising the intensities of the red, blue, and green channels, and our segmentation
algorithm simply treats each pixel in the image as a separate data point. Note that
strictly this space is not Euclidean because the channel intensities are bounded by
the interval [0, 1]. Nevertheless, we can apply the K-means algorithm without difﬁ-
culty. We illustrate the result of running K-means to convergence, for any particular
value of K, by re-drawing the image replacing each pixel vector with the {R, G, B}
intensity triplet given by the centre µk to which that pixel has been assigned. Results
for various values of K are shown in Figure 9.3. We see that for a given value of K,
the algorithm is representing the image using a palette of only K colours. It should
be emphasized that this use of K-means is not a particularly sophisticated approach
to image segmentation, not least because it takes no account of the spatial proximity
of different pixels. The image segmentation problem is in general extremely difﬁcult

Figure 9.3 Two examples of the application of the K-means clustering algorithm to image segmentation show-
ing the initial images together with their K-means segmentations obtained using various values of K. This
also illustrates of the use of vector quantization for data compression, in which smaller values of K give higher
compression at the expense of poorer image quality.

and remains the subject of active research and is introduced here simply to illustrate
the behaviour of the K-means algorithm.

We can also use the result of a clustering algorithm to perform data compres-
sion.
It is important to distinguish between lossless data compression, in which
the goal is to be able to reconstruct the original data exactly from the compressed
representation, and lossy data compression, in which we accept some errors in the
reconstruction in return for higher levels of compression than can be achieved in the
lossless case. We can apply the K-means algorithm to the problem of lossy data
compression as follows. For each of the N data points, we store only the identity
k of the cluster to which it is assigned. We also store the values of the K clus-
ter centres µk, which typically requires signiﬁcantly less data, provided we choose
K (cid:13) N. Each data point is then approximated by its nearest centre µk. New data
points can similarly be compressed by ﬁrst ﬁnding the nearest µk and then storing
the label k instead of the original data vector. This framework is often called vector
quantization, and the vectors µk are called code-book vectors.

430

9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM

The image segmentation problem discussed above also provides an illustration
of the use of clustering for data compression. Suppose the original image has N
pixels comprising {R, G, B} values each of which is stored with 8 bits of precision.
Then to transmit the whole image directly would cost 24N bits. Now suppose we
ﬁrst run K-means on the image data, and then instead of transmitting the original
pixel intensity vectors we transmit the identity of the nearest vector µk. Because
there are K such vectors, this requires log2 K bits per pixel. We must also transmit
the K code book vectors µk, which requires 24K bits, and so the total number of
bits required to transmit the image is 24K + N log2 K (rounding up to the nearest
integer). The original image shown in Figure 9.3 has 240 × 180 = 43, 200 pixels
and so requires 24 × 43, 200 = 1, 036, 800 bits to transmit directly. By comparison,
the compressed images require 43, 248 bits (K = 2), 86, 472 bits (K = 3), and
173, 040 bits (K = 10), respectively, to transmit. These represent compression ratios
compared to the original image of 4.2%, 8.3%, and 16.7%, respectively. We see that
there is a trade-off between degree of compression and image quality. Note that our
aim in this example is to illustrate the K-means algorithm. If we had been aiming to
produce a good image compressor, then it would be more fruitful to consider small
blocks of adjacent pixels, for instance 5× 5, and thereby exploit the correlations that
exist in natural images between nearby pixels.

9.2. Mixtures of Gaussians

In Section 2.3.9 we motivated the Gaussian mixture model as a simple linear super-
position of Gaussian components, aimed at providing a richer class of density mod-
els than the single Gaussian. We now turn to a formulation of Gaussian mixtures in
terms of discrete latent variables. This will provide us with a deeper insight into this
important distribution, and will also serve to motivate the expectation-maximization
algorithm.

Recall from (2.188) that the Gaussian mixture distribution can be written as a

linear superposition of Gaussians in the form

p(x) =

πkN (x|µk, Σk).

(9.7)

Let us introduce a K-dimensional binary random variable z having a 1-of-K repre-
sentation in which a particular element zk is equal to 1 and all other elements are
equal to 0. The values of zk therefore satisfy zk ∈ {0, 1} and
k zk = 1, and we
see that there are K possible states for the vector z according to which element is
nonzero. We shall deﬁne the joint distribution p(x, z) in terms of a marginal dis-
tribution p(z) and a conditional distribution p(x|z), corresponding to the graphical
model in Figure 9.4. The marginal distribution over z is speciﬁed in terms of the
mixing coefﬁcients πk, such that

(9.9)

in order to be valid probabilities. Because z uses a 1-of-K representation, we can
also write this distribution in the form

p(z) =

πzk
k .

(9.10)

Similarly, the conditional distribution of x given a particular value for z is a Gaussian

k=1

p(x|zk = 1) = N (x|µk, Σk)

K(cid:14)

K(cid:14)

which can also be written in the form

p(x|z) =

N (x|µk, Σk)zk .

(9.11)

Exercise 9.3

The joint distribution is given by p(z)p(x|z), and the marginal distribution of x is
then obtained by summing the joint distribution over all possible states of z to give

(cid:2)

K(cid:2)

p(x) =

p(z)p(x|z) =

πkN (x|µk, Σk)

(9.12)

k=1

(cid:5)

where we have made use of (9.10) and (9.11). Thus the marginal distribution of x is
a Gaussian mixture of the form (9.7). If we have several observations x1, . . . , xN ,
then, because we have represented the marginal distribution in the form p(x) =
z p(x, z), it follows that for every observed data point xn there is a corresponding

latent variable zn.

We have therefore found an equivalent formulation of the Gaussian mixture in-
volving an explicit latent variable.
It might seem that we have not gained much
by doing so. However, we are now able to work with the joint distribution p(x, z)

432

9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM

instead of the marginal distribution p(x), and this will lead to signiﬁcant simpliﬁca-
tions, most notably through the introduction of the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm.
Another quantity that will play an important role is the conditional probability
of z given x. We shall use γ(zk) to denote p(zk = 1|x), whose value can be found
using Bayes’ theorem

γ(zk) ≡ p(zk = 1|x) =

=

K(cid:2)
p(zk = 1)p(x|zk = 1)
p(zj = 1)p(x|zj = 1)
K(cid:2)
πkN (x|µk, Σk)
πjN (x|µj, Σj)

j=1

.

(9.13)

Section 8.1.2

j=1

We shall view πk as the prior probability of zk = 1, and the quantity γ(zk) as the
corresponding posterior probability once we have observed x. As we shall see later,
γ(zk) can also be viewed as the responsibility that component k takes for ‘explain-
ing’ the observation x.

We can use the technique of ancestral sampling to generate random samples
distributed according to the Gaussian mixture model. To do this, we ﬁrst generate a

value for z, which we denote(cid:1)z, from the marginal distribution p(z) and then generate
a value for x from the conditional distribution p(x|(cid:1)z). Techniques for sampling from

standard distributions are discussed in Chapter 11. We can depict samples from the
joint distribution p(x, z) by plotting points at the corresponding values of x and
then colouring them according to the value of z, in other words according to which
Gaussian component was responsible for generating them, as shown in Figure 9.5(a).
Similarly samples from the marginal distribution p(x) are obtained by taking the
samples from the joint distribution and ignoring the values of z. These are illustrated
in Figure 9.5(b) by plotting the x values without any coloured labels.

We can also use this synthetic data set to illustrate the ‘responsibilities’ by eval-
uating, for every data point, the posterior probability for each component in the
mixture distribution from which this data set was generated. In particular, we can
represent the value of the responsibilities γ(znk) associated with data point xn by
plotting the corresponding point using proportions of red, blue, and green ink given
by γ(znk) for k = 1, 2, 3, respectively, as shown in Figure 9.5(c). So, for instance,
a data point for which γ(zn1) = 1 will be coloured red, whereas one for which
γ(zn2) = γ(zn3) = 0.5 will be coloured with equal proportions of blue and green
ink and so will appear cyan. This should be compared with Figure 9.5(a) in which
the data points were labelled using the true identity of the component from which
they were generated.

this data using a mixture of Gaussians. We can represent this data set as an N × D

the data points are drawn independently from the distribution, then we can express
the Gaussian mixture model for this i.i.d. data set using the graphical representation
shown in Figure 9.6. From (9.7) the log of the likelihood function is given by

Before discussing how to maximize this function, it is worth emphasizing that
there is a signiﬁcant problem associated with the maximum likelihood framework
applied to Gaussian mixture models, due to the presence of singularities. For sim-
plicity, consider a Gaussian mixture whose components have covariance matrices
given by Σk = σ2
kI, where I is the unit matrix, although the conclusions will hold
for general covariance matrices. Suppose that one of the components of the mixture
model, let us say the jth component, has its mean µj exactly equal to one of the data

term in the likelihood function of the form

.

N (xn|xn, σ2

j I) =

(2π)1/2

(9.15)
If we consider the limit σj → 0, then we see that this term goes to inﬁnity and
so the log likelihood function will also go to inﬁnity. Thus the maximization of
the log likelihood function is not a well posed problem because such singularities
will always be present and will occur whenever one of the Gaussian components
‘collapses’ onto a speciﬁc data point. Recall that this problem did not arise in the
case of a single Gaussian distribution. To understand the difference, note that if a
single Gaussian collapses onto a data point it will contribute multiplicative factors
to the likelihood function arising from the other data points and these factors will go
to zero exponentially fast, giving an overall likelihood that goes to zero rather than
inﬁnity. However, once we have (at least) two components in the mixture, one of
the components can have a ﬁnite variance and therefore assign ﬁnite probability to
all of the data points while the other component can shrink onto one speciﬁc data
point and thereby contribute an ever increasing additive value to the log likelihood.
This is illustrated in Figure 9.7. These singularities provide another example of the
severe over-ﬁtting that can occur in a maximum likelihood approach. We shall see
that this difﬁculty does not occur if we adopt a Bayesian approach. For the moment,
however, we simply note that in applying maximum likelihood to Gaussian mixture
models we must take steps to avoid ﬁnding such pathological solutions and instead
seek local maxima of the likelihood function that are well behaved. We can hope to
avoid the singularities by using suitable heuristics, for instance by detecting when a
Gaussian component is collapsing and resetting its mean to a randomly chosen value
while also resetting its covariance to some large value, and then continuing with the
optimization.

A further issue in ﬁnding maximum likelihood solutions arises from the fact
that for any given maximum likelihood solution, a K-component mixture will have
a total of K! equivalent solutions corresponding to the K! ways of assigning K
sets of parameters to K components. In other words, for any given (nondegenerate)
point in the space of parameter values there will be a further K!−1 additional points
all of which give rise to exactly the same distribution. This problem is known as

Section 10.1

9.2. Mixtures of Gaussians

435

identiﬁability (Casella and Berger, 2002) and is an important issue when we wish to
interpret the parameter values discovered by a model. Identiﬁability will also arise
when we discuss models having continuous latent variables in Chapter 12. However,
for the purposes of ﬁnding a good density model, it is irrelevant because any of the
equivalent solutions is as good as any other.

Maximizing the log likelihood function (9.14) for a Gaussian mixture model
turns out to be a more complex problem than for the case of a single Gaussian. The
difﬁculty arises from the presence of the summation over k that appears inside the
logarithm in (9.14), so that the logarithm function no longer acts directly on the
Gaussian. If we set the derivatives of the log likelihood to zero, we will no longer
obtain a closed form solution, as we shall see shortly.

One approach is to apply gradient-based optimization techniques (Fletcher, 1987;
Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and Nabney, 2008). Although gradient-based
techniques are feasible, and indeed will play an important role when we discuss
mixture density networks in Chapter 5, we now consider an alternative approach
known as the EM algorithm which has broad applicability and which will lay the
foundations for a discussion of variational inference techniques in Chapter 10.

9.2.2 EM for Gaussian mixtures
An elegant and powerful method for ﬁnding maximum likelihood solutions for
models with latent variables is called the expectation-maximization algorithm, or EM
algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997). Later we shall
give a general treatment of EM, and we shall also show how EM can be generalized
to obtain the variational inference framework. Initially, we shall motivate the EM
algorithm by giving a relatively informal treatment in the context of the Gaussian
mixture model. We emphasize, however, that EM has broad applicability, and indeed
it will be encountered in the context of a variety of different models in this book.
Let us begin by writing down the conditions that must be satisﬁed at a maximum
of the likelihood function. Setting the derivatives of ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) in (9.14) with
respect to the means µk of the Gaussian components to zero, we obtain

We can interpret Nk as the effective number of points assigned to cluster k. Note
carefully the form of this solution. We see that the mean µk for the kth Gaussian
component is obtained by taking a weighted mean of all of the points in the data set,
in which the weighting factor for data point xn is given by the posterior probability
γ(znk) that component k was responsible for generating xn.
If we set the derivative of ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) with respect to Σk to zero, and follow
a similar line of reasoning, making use of the result for the maximum likelihood
solution for the covariance matrix of a single Gaussian, we obtain

γ(znk)(xn − µk)(xn − µk)T

Nk

which has the same form as the corresponding result for a single Gaussian ﬁtted to
the data set, but again with each data point weighted by the corresponding poste-
rior probability and with the denominator given by the effective number of points
associated with the corresponding component.
Finally, we maximize ln p(X|π, µ, Σ) with respect to the mixing coefﬁcients
πk. Here we must take account of the constraint (9.9), which requires the mixing
coefﬁcients to sum to one. This can be achieved using a Lagrange multiplier and
maximizing the following quantity

(cid:22)
K(cid:2)

(9.21)

where again we see the appearance of the responsibilities. If we now multiply both
sides by πk and sum over k making use of the constraint (9.9), we ﬁnd λ = −N.
Using this to eliminate λ and rearranging we obtain

πk = Nk
N

(9.22)

so that the mixing coefﬁcient for the kth component is given by the average respon-
sibility which that component takes for explaining the data points.

It is worth emphasizing that the results (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22) do not con-
stitute a closed-form solution for the parameters of the mixture model because the
responsibilities γ(znk) depend on those parameters in a complex way through (9.13).
However, these results do suggest a simple iterative scheme for ﬁnding a solution to
the maximum likelihood problem, which as we shall see turns out to be an instance
of the EM algorithm for the particular case of the Gaussian mixture model. We
ﬁrst choose some initial values for the means, covariances, and mixing coefﬁcients.
Then we alternate between the following two updates that we shall call the E step

and the M step, for reasons that will become apparent shortly. In the expectation
step, or E step, we use the current values for the parameters to evaluate the posterior
probabilities, or responsibilities, given by (9.13). We then use these probabilities in
the maximization step, or M step, to re-estimate the means, covariances, and mix-
ing coefﬁcients using the results (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22). Note that in so doing
we ﬁrst evaluate the new means using (9.17) and then use these new values to ﬁnd
the covariances using (9.19), in keeping with the corresponding result for a single
Gaussian distribution. We shall show that each update to the parameters resulting
from an E step followed by an M step is guaranteed to increase the log likelihood
function. In practice, the algorithm is deemed to have converged when the change
in the log likelihood function, or alternatively in the parameters, falls below some
threshold. We illustrate the EM algorithm for a mixture of two Gaussians applied to
the rescaled Old Faithful data set in Figure 9.8. Here a mixture of two Gaussians
is used, with centres initialized using the same values as for the K-means algorithm
in Figure 9.1, and with precision matrices initialized to be proportional to the unit
matrix. Plot (a) shows the data points in green, together with the initial conﬁgura-
tion of the mixture model in which the one standard-deviation contours for the two

438

9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM

Gaussian components are shown as blue and red circles. Plot (b) shows the result
of the initial E step, in which each data point is depicted using a proportion of blue
ink equal to the posterior probability of having been generated from the blue com-
ponent, and a corresponding proportion of red ink given by the posterior probability
of having been generated by the red component. Thus, points that have a signiﬁcant
probability for belonging to either cluster appear purple. The situation after the ﬁrst
M step is shown in plot (c), in which the mean of the blue Gaussian has moved to
the mean of the data set, weighted by the probabilities of each data point belonging
to the blue cluster, in other words it has moved to the centre of mass of the blue ink.
Similarly, the covariance of the blue Gaussian is set equal to the covariance of the
blue ink. Analogous results hold for the red component. Plots (d), (e), and (f) show
the results after 2, 5, and 20 complete cycles of EM, respectively. In plot (f) the
algorithm is close to convergence.

Note that the EM algorithm takes many more iterations to reach (approximate)
convergence compared with the K-means algorithm, and that each cycle requires
signiﬁcantly more computation. It is therefore common to run the K-means algo-
rithm in order to ﬁnd a suitable initialization for a Gaussian mixture model that is
subsequently adapted using EM. The covariance matrices can conveniently be ini-
tialized to the sample covariances of the clusters found by the K-means algorithm,
and the mixing coefﬁcients can be set to the fractions of data points assigned to the
respective clusters. As with gradient-based approaches for maximizing the log like-
lihood, techniques must be employed to avoid singularities of the likelihood function
in which a Gaussian component collapses onto a particular data point. It should be
emphasized that there will generally be multiple local maxima of the log likelihood
function, and that EM is not guaranteed to ﬁnd the largest of these maxima. Because
the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures plays such an important role, we summarize
it below.

EM for Gaussian Mixtures

Given a Gaussian mixture model, the goal is to maximize the likelihood function
with respect to the parameters (comprising the means and covariances of the
components and the mixing coefﬁcients).

9.3. An Alternative View of EM

In this section, we present a complementary view of the EM algorithm that recog-
nizes the key role played by latent variables. We discuss this approach ﬁrst of all
in an abstract setting, and then for illustration we consider once again the case of
Gaussian mixtures.

The goal of the EM algorithm is to ﬁnd maximum likelihood solutions for mod-
els having latent variables. We denote the set of all observed data by X, in which the
nth row represents xT
n, and similarly we denote the set of all latent variables by Z,
with a corresponding row zT
n. The set of all model parameters is denoted by θ, and
so the log likelihood function is given by

(cid:24)(cid:2)

(cid:25)

ln p(X|θ) = ln

p(X, Z|θ)

.

(9.29)

Z

Note that our discussion will apply equally well to continuous latent variables simply
by replacing the sum over Z with an integral.
A key observation is that the summation over the latent variables appears inside
the logarithm. Even if the joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) belongs to the exponential

440

9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM

family, the marginal distribution p(X|θ) typically does not as a result of this sum-
mation. The presence of the sum prevents the logarithm from acting directly on the
joint distribution, resulting in complicated expressions for the maximum likelihood
solution.
Now suppose that, for each observation in X, we were told the corresponding
value of the latent variable Z. We shall call {X, Z} the complete data set, and we
shall refer to the actual observed data X as incomplete, as illustrated in Figure 9.5.
The likelihood function for the complete data set simply takes the form ln p(X, Z|θ),
and we shall suppose that maximization of this complete-data log likelihood function
is straightforward.
In practice, however, we are not given the complete data set {X, Z}, but only
the incomplete data X. Our state of knowledge of the values of the latent variables
in Z is given only by the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θ). Because we cannot use
the complete-data log likelihood, we consider instead its expected value under the
posterior distribution of the latent variable, which corresponds (as we shall see) to the
E step of the EM algorithm. In the subsequent M step, we maximize this expectation.
If the current estimate for the parameters is denoted θold, then a pair of successive
E and M steps gives rise to a revised estimate θnew. The algorithm is initialized by
choosing some starting value for the parameters θ0. The use of the expectation may
seem somewhat arbitrary. However, we shall see the motivation for this choice when
we give a deeper treatment of EM in Section 9.4.
In the E step, we use the current parameter values θold to ﬁnd the posterior
distribution of the latent variables given by p(Z|X, θold). We then use this posterior
distribution to ﬁnd the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood evaluated for
some general parameter value θ. This expectation, denoted Q(θ, θold), is given by

Q(θ, θold) =

p(Z|X, θold) ln p(X, Z|θ).

(9.30)

(cid:2)

Z

In the M step, we determine the revised parameter estimate θnew by maximizing this
function

θnew = arg max

(9.31)
Note that in the deﬁnition of Q(θ, θold), the logarithm acts directly on the joint
distribution p(X, Z|θ), and so the corresponding M-step maximization will, by sup-
position, be tractable.

Q(θ, θold).

Section 9.4

The general EM algorithm is summarized below. It has the property, as we shall
show later, that each cycle of EM will increase the incomplete-data log likelihood
(unless it is already at a local maximum).

The General EM Algorithm
Given a joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) over observed variables X and latent vari-
ables Z, governed by parameters θ, the goal is to maximize the likelihood func-
tion p(X|θ) with respect to θ.
1. Choose an initial setting for the parameters θold.

where

Q(θ, θold) =

4. Check for convergence of either the log likelihood or the parameter values.

If the convergence criterion is not satisﬁed, then let

θold ← θnew

(9.34)

and return to step 2.

The EM algorithm can also be used to ﬁnd MAP (maximum posterior) solutions
for models in which a prior p(θ) is deﬁned over the parameters. In this case the E
step remains the same as in the maximum likelihood case, whereas in the M step the
quantity to be maximized is given by Q(θ, θold) + ln p(θ). Suitable choices for the
prior will remove the singularities of the kind illustrated in Figure 9.7.

Here we have considered the use of the EM algorithm to maximize a likelihood
function when there are discrete latent variables. However, it can also be applied
when the unobserved variables correspond to missing values in the data set. The
distribution of the observed values is obtained by taking the joint distribution of all
the variables and then marginalizing over the missing ones. EM can then be used
to maximize the corresponding likelihood function. We shall show an example of
the application of this technique in the context of principal component analysis in
Figure 12.11. This will be a valid procedure if the data values are missing at random,
meaning that the mechanism causing values to be missing does not depend on the
unobserved values. In many situations this will not be the case, for instance if a
sensor fails to return a value whenever the quantity it is measuring exceeds some
threshold.

9.3.1 Gaussian mixtures revisited
We now consider the application of this latent variable view of EM to the spe-
ciﬁc case of a Gaussian mixture model. Recall that our goal is to maximize the log
likelihood function (9.14), which is computed using the observed data set X, and we
saw that this was more difﬁcult than for the case of a single Gaussian distribution
due to the presence of the summation over k that occurs inside the logarithm. Sup-
pose then that in addition to the observed data set X, we were also given the values
of the corresponding discrete variables Z. Recall that Figure 9.5(a) shows a ‘com-
plete’ data set (i.e., one that includes labels showing which component generated
each data point) while Figure 9.5(b) shows the corresponding ‘incomplete’ data set.
The graphical model for the complete data is shown in Figure 9.9.

442

Figure 9.9 This shows the same graph as in Figure 9.6 except that
we now suppose that the discrete variables zn are ob-
served, as well as the data variables xn.

Now consider the problem of maximizing the likelihood for the complete data

set {X, Z}. From (9.10) and (9.11), this likelihood function takes the form

p(X, Z|µ, Σ, π) =

k N (xn|µk, Σk)znk
πznk

(9.35)

where znk denotes the kth component of zn. Taking the logarithm, we obtain

ln p(X, Z|µ, Σ, π) =

znk {ln πk + lnN (xn|µk, Σk)} .

Comparison with the log likelihood function (9.14) for the incomplete data shows
that the summation over k and the logarithm have been interchanged. The loga-
rithm now acts directly on the Gaussian distribution, which itself is a member of
the exponential family. Not surprisingly, this leads to a much simpler solution to
the maximum likelihood problem, as we now show. Consider ﬁrst the maximization
with respect to the means and covariances. Because zn is a K-dimensional vec-
tor with all elements equal to 0 except for a single element having the value 1, the
complete-data log likelihood function is simply a sum of K independent contribu-
tions, one for each mixture component. Thus the maximization with respect to a
mean or a covariance is exactly as for a single Gaussian, except that it involves only
the subset of data points that are ‘assigned’ to that component. For the maximization
with respect to the mixing coefﬁcients, we note that these are coupled for different
values of k by virtue of the summation constraint (9.9). Again, this can be enforced
using a Lagrange multiplier as before, and leads to the result

N(cid:2)

πk =

1
N

znk

n=1

(9.37)

so that the mixing coefﬁcients are equal to the fractions of data points assigned to
the corresponding components.

Thus we see that the complete-data log likelihood function can be maximized
trivially in closed form. In practice, however, we do not have values for the latent
variables so, as discussed earlier, we consider the expectation, with respect to the
posterior distribution of the latent variables, of the complete-data log likelihood.

Using (9.10) and (9.11) together with Bayes’ theorem, we see that this posterior

and hence factorizes over n so that under the posterior distribution the {zn} are
independent. This is easily veriﬁed by inspection of the directed graph in Figure 9.6

and making use of the d-separation criterion. The expected value of the indicator
variable znk under this posterior distribution is then given by

which is just the responsibility of component k for data point xn. The expected value

EZ[ln p(X, Z|µ, Σ, π)] =

γ(znk){ln πk + lnN (xn|µk, Σk)} .

(9.40)

n=1

k=1

We can now proceed as follows. First we choose some initial values for the param-
eters µold, Σold and πold, and use these to evaluate the responsibilities (the E step).
We then keep the responsibilities ﬁxed and maximize (9.40) with respect to µk, Σk
and πk (the M step). This leads to closed form solutions for µnew, Σnew and πnew
given by (9.17), (9.19), and (9.22) as before. This is precisely the EM algorithm for
Gaussian mixtures as derived earlier. We shall gain more insight into the role of the
expected complete-data log likelihood function when we give a proof of convergence
of the EM algorithm in Section 9.4.

9.3.2 Relation to K-means
Comparison of the K-means algorithm with the EM algorithm for Gaussian
mixtures shows that there is a close similarity. Whereas the K-means algorithm
performs a hard assignment of data points to clusters, in which each data point is
associated uniquely with one cluster, the EM algorithm makes a soft assignment
based on the posterior probabilities. In fact, we can derive the K-means algorithm
as a particular limit of EM for Gaussian mixtures as follows.

Consider a Gaussian mixture model in which the covariance matrices of the
mixture components are given by I, where  is a variance parameter that is shared

444

9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM

by all of the components, and I is the identity matrix, so that

p(x|µk, Σk) =

1

(2π)1/2 exp

− 1
2

(cid:5)x − µk(cid:5)2

(cid:12)

(cid:13)

.

(9.41)

We now consider the EM algorithm for a mixture of K Gaussians of this form in
which we treat  as a ﬁxed constant, instead of a parameter to be re-estimated. From
(9.13) the posterior probabilities, or responsibilities, for a particular data point xn,
are given by

(cid:26)−(cid:5)xn − µj(cid:5)2/2
(cid:27) .
γ(znk) = πk exp{−(cid:5)xn − µk(cid:5)2/2}

(cid:5)

j πj exp

(9.42)
If we consider the limit  → 0, we see that in the denominator the term for which
(cid:5)xn − µj(cid:5)2 is smallest will go to zero most slowly, and hence the responsibilities
γ(znk) for the data point xn all go to zero except for term j, for which the responsi-
bility γ(znj) will go to unity. Note that this holds independently of the values of the
πk so long as none of the πk is zero. Thus, in this limit, we obtain a hard assignment
of data points to clusters, just as in the K-means algorithm, so that γ(znk) → rnk
where rnk is deﬁned by (9.2). Each data point is thereby assigned to the cluster
having the closest mean.

The EM re-estimation equation for the µk, given by (9.17), then reduces to the
K-means result (9.4). Note that the re-estimation formula for the mixing coefﬁcients
(9.22) simply re-sets the value of πk to be equal to the fraction of data points assigned
to cluster k, although these parameters no longer play an active role in the algorithm.
Finally, in the limit  → 0 the expected complete-data log likelihood, given by

Exercise 9.11

(9.40), becomes

EZ[ln p(X, Z|µ, Σ, π)] → −1
2

N(cid:2)

K(cid:2)

n=1

k=1

rnk(cid:5)xn − µk(cid:5)2 + const.

(9.43)

Thus we see that in this limit, maximizing the expected complete-data log likelihood
is equivalent to minimizing the distortion measure J for the K-means algorithm
given by (9.1).

Note that the K-means algorithm does not estimate the covariances of the clus-
ters but only the cluster means. A hard-assignment version of the Gaussian mixture
model with general covariance matrices, known as the elliptical K-means algorithm,
has been considered by Sung and Poggio (1994).

9.3.3 Mixtures of Bernoulli distributions
So far in this chapter, we have focussed on distributions over continuous vari-
ables described by mixtures of Gaussians. As a further example of mixture mod-
elling, and to illustrate the EM algorithm in a different context, we now discuss mix-
tures of discrete binary variables described by Bernoulli distributions. This model
is also known as latent class analysis (Lazarsfeld and Henry, 1968; McLachlan and
Peel, 2000). As well as being of practical importance in its own right, our discus-
sion of Bernoulli mixtures will also lay the foundation for a consideration of hidden
Markov models over discrete variables.

D(cid:14)

Consider a set of D binary variables xi, where i = 1, . . . , D, each of which is

governed by a Bernoulli distribution with parameter µi, so that

i=1

where x = (x1, . . . , xD)T and µ = (µ1, . . . , µD)T. We see that the individual
variables xi are independent, given µ. The mean and covariance of this distribution
are easily seen to be

E[x] = µ
cov[x] = diag{µi(1 − µi)}.

Now let us consider a ﬁnite mixture of these distributions given by

for this model is given by

the mixture of Bernoulli distributions. To do this, we ﬁrst introduce an explicit latent

variable z associated with each instance of x. As in the case of the Gaussian mixture,
z = (z1, . . . , zK)T is a binary K-dimensional variable having a single component
equal to 1, with all other components equal to 0. We can then write the conditional
distribution of x, given the latent variable, as

p(x|z, µ) =

while the prior distribution for the latent variables is the same as for the mixture of

If we form the product of p(x|z, µ) and p(z|π) and then marginalize over z, then we
recover (9.47).

parameters µk and π. If we set the derivative of (9.55) with respect to µk equal to
zero and rearrange the terms, we obtain

Exercise 9.15

Exercise 9.16

Exercise 9.17

Section 9.4

µk = xk.

(9.59)

We see that this sets the mean of component k equal to a weighted mean of the
data, with weighting coefﬁcients given by the responsibilities that component k takes
for data points. For the maximization with respect to πk, we need to introduce a
k πk = 1. Following analogous
Lagrange multiplier to enforce the constraint
steps to those used for the mixture of Gaussians, we then obtain

(cid:5)

πk = Nk
N

(9.60)

which represents the intuitively reasonable result that the mixing coefﬁcient for com-
ponent k is given by the effective fraction of points in the data set explained by that
component.

Note that in contrast to the mixture of Gaussians, there are no singularities in
which the likelihood function goes to inﬁnity. This can be seen by noting that the
likelihood function is bounded above because 0 (cid:1) p(xn|µk) (cid:1) 1. There exist
singularities at which the likelihood function goes to zero, but these will not be
found by EM provided it is not initialized to a pathological starting point, because
the EM algorithm always increases the value of the likelihood function, until a local
maximum is found. We illustrate the Bernoulli mixture model in Figure 9.10 by
using it to model handwritten digits. Here the digit images have been turned into
binary vectors by setting all elements whose values exceed 0.5 to 1 and setting the
remaining elements to 0. We now ﬁt a data set of N = 600 such digits, comprising
the digits ‘2’, ‘3’, and ‘4’, with a mixture of K = 3 Bernoulli distributions by
running 10 iterations of the EM algorithm. The mixing coefﬁcients were initialized
to πk = 1/K, and the parameters µkj were set to random values chosen uniformly in

We see that a mixture of 3 Bernoulli distributions is able to ﬁnd the three clusters in
the data set corresponding to the different digits.

The conjugate prior for the parameters of a Bernoulli distribution is given by
the beta distribution, and we have seen that a beta prior is equivalent to introducing

we also ﬁt the same data set using a single multivariate Bernoulli distribution, again using maximum likelihood.
This amounts to simply averaging the counts in each pixel and is shown by the right-most image on the bottom

additional effective observations of x. We can similarly introduce priors into the
Bernoulli mixture model, and use EM to maximize the posterior probability distri-
butions.

It is straightforward to extend the analysis of Bernoulli mixtures to the case of
multinomial binary variables having M > 2 states by making use of the discrete dis-
tribution (2.26). Again, we can introduce Dirichlet priors over the model parameters
if desired.

9.3.4 EM for Bayesian linear regression
As a third example of the application of EM, we return to the evidence ap-
proximation for Bayesian linear regression. In Section 3.5.2, we obtained the re-
estimation equations for the hyperparameters α and β by evaluation of the evidence
and then setting the derivatives of the resulting expression to zero. We now turn to
an alternative approach for ﬁnding α and β based on the EM algorithm. Recall that
our goal is to maximize the evidence function p(t|α, β) given by (3.77) with respect
to α and β. Because the parameter vector w is marginalized out, we can regard it as
a latent variable, and hence we can optimize this marginal likelihood function using
EM. In the E step, we compute the posterior distribution of w given the current set-
ting of the parameters α and β and then use this to ﬁnd the expected complete-data
log likelihood. In the M step, we maximize this quantity with respect to α and β. We
have already derived the posterior distribution of w because this is given by (3.49).
The complete-data log likelihood function is then given by

ln p(t, w|α, β) = ln p(t|w, β) + ln p(w|α)

(9.61)

where the likelihood p(t|w, β) and the prior p(w|α) are given by (3.10) and (3.52),
respectively, and y(x, w) is given by (3.3). Taking the expectation with respect to
the posterior distribution of w then gives

An analogous result holds for β.

Note that this re-estimation equation takes a slightly different form from the
corresponding result (3.92) derived by direct evaluation of the evidence function.
However, they each involve computation and inversion (or eigen decomposition) of
an M × M matrix and hence will have comparable computational cost per iteration.
These two approaches to determining α should of course converge to the same
result (assuming they ﬁnd the same local maximum of the evidence function). This
can be veriﬁed by ﬁrst noting that the quantity γ is deﬁned by

and solving for α we obtain (9.63), which is precisely the EM re-estimation equation.
As a ﬁnal example, we consider a closely related model, namely the relevance
vector machine for regression discussed in Section 7.2.1. There we used direct max-
imization of the marginal likelihood to derive re-estimation equations for the hyper-
parameters α and β. Here we consider an alternative approach in which we view the
weight vector w as a latent variable and apply the EM algorithm. The E step involves
ﬁnding the posterior distribution over the weights, and this is given by (7.81). In the
M step we maximize the expected complete-data log likelihood, which is deﬁned by

9.4. The EM Algorithm in General

The expectation maximization algorithm, or EM algorithm, is a general technique for
ﬁnding maximum likelihood solutions for probabilistic models having latent vari-
ables (Dempster et al., 1977; McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997). Here we give a very
general treatment of the EM algorithm and in the process provide a proof that the
EM algorithm derived heuristically in Sections 9.2 and 9.3 for Gaussian mixtures
does indeed maximize the likelihood function (Csisz`ar and Tusn`ady, 1984; Hath-
away, 1986; Neal and Hinton, 1999). Our discussion will also form the basis for the
derivation of the variational inference framework.

Section 10.1

Consider a probabilistic model in which we collectively denote all of the ob-
served variables by X and all of the hidden variables by Z. The joint distribution
p(X, Z|θ) is governed by a set of parameters denoted θ. Our goal is to maximize
the likelihood function that is given by
p(X|θ) =

p(X, Z|θ).

(cid:2)

(9.69)

Z

Here we are assuming Z is discrete, although the discussion is identical if Z com-
prises continuous variables or a combination of discrete and continuous variables,
with summation replaced by integration as appropriate.
We shall suppose that direct optimization of p(X|θ) is difﬁcult, but that opti-
mization of the complete-data likelihood function p(X, Z|θ) is signiﬁcantly easier.
Next we introduce a distribution q(Z) deﬁned over the latent variables, and we ob-
serve that, for any choice of q(Z), the following decomposition holds

ln p(X|θ) = L(q, θ) + KL(q(cid:5)p)

where we have deﬁned

L(q, θ) =

q(Z) ln

Note that L(q, θ) is a functional (see Appendix D for a discussion of functionals)
of the distribution q(Z), and a function of the parameters θ. It is worth studying

Because the
Kullback-Leibler divergence satisﬁes
KL(q(cid:3)p) (cid:2) 0, we see that the quan-
tity L(q, θ) is a lower bound on the log
likelihood function ln p(X|θ).

carefully the forms of the expressions (9.71) and (9.72), and in particular noting that
they differ in sign and also that L(q, θ) contains the joint distribution of X and Z
while KL(q(cid:5)p) contains the conditional distribution of Z given X. To verify the
decomposition (9.70), we ﬁrst make use of the product rule of probability to give

ln p(X, Z|θ) = ln p(Z|X, θ) + ln p(X|θ)

(9.73)
which we then substitute into the expression for L(q, θ). This gives rise to two terms,
one of which cancels KL(q(cid:5)p) while the other gives the required log likelihood
ln p(X|θ) after noting that q(Z) is a normalized distribution that sums to 1.
From (9.72), we see that KL(q(cid:5)p) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between
q(Z) and the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θ). Recall that the Kullback-Leibler di-
vergence satisﬁes KL(q(cid:5)p) (cid:2) 0, with equality if, and only if, q(Z) = p(Z|X, θ). It
therefore follows from (9.70) that L(q, θ) (cid:1) ln p(X|θ), in other words that L(q, θ)
is a lower bound on ln p(X|θ). The decomposition (9.70) is illustrated in Fig-
ure 9.11.

The EM algorithm is a two-stage iterative optimization technique for ﬁnding
maximum likelihood solutions. We can use the decomposition (9.70) to deﬁne the
EM algorithm and to demonstrate that it does indeed maximize the log likelihood.
Suppose that the current value of the parameter vector is θold. In the E step, the
lower bound L(q, θold) is maximized with respect to q(Z) while holding θold ﬁxed.
The solution to this maximization problem is easily seen by noting that the value
of ln p(X|θold) does not depend on q(Z) and so the largest value of L(q, θold) will
occur when the Kullback-Leibler divergence vanishes, in other words when q(Z) is
equal to the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θold). In this case, the lower bound will
equal the log likelihood, as illustrated in Figure 9.12.
In the subsequent M step, the distribution q(Z) is held ﬁxed and the lower bound
L(q, θ) is maximized with respect to θ to give some new value θnew. This will
cause the lower bound L to increase (unless it is already at a maximum), which will
necessarily cause the corresponding log likelihood function to increase. Because the
distribution q is determined using the old parameter values rather than the new values
and is held ﬁxed during the M step, it will not equal the new posterior distribution
p(Z|X, θnew), and hence there will be a nonzero KL divergence. The increase in the
log likelihood function is therefore greater than the increase in the lower bound, as

452

distribution is set equal to

same value as the log like-
lihood function, with the KL
divergence vanishing.

L(q, θold)

ln p(X|θold)

shown in Figure 9.13. If we substitute q(Z) = p(Z|X, θold) into (9.71), we see that,
after the E step, the lower bound takes the form
L(q, θ) =
p(Z|X, θold) ln p(X, Z|θ) −

p(Z|X, θold) ln p(Z|X, θold)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

Z

= Q(θ, θold) + const

(9.74)

where the constant is simply the negative entropy of the q distribution and is there-
fore independent of θ. Thus in the M step, the quantity that is being maximized is the
expectation of the complete-data log likelihood, as we saw earlier in the case of mix-
tures of Gaussians. Note that the variable θ over which we are optimizing appears
only inside the logarithm. If the joint distribution p(Z, X|θ) comprises a member of
the exponential family, or a product of such members, then we see that the logarithm
will cancel the exponential and lead to an M step that will be typically much simpler
than the maximization of the corresponding incomplete-data log likelihood function
p(X|θ).

The operation of the EM algorithm can also be viewed in the space of parame-
ters, as illustrated schematically in Figure 9.14. Here the red curve depicts the (in-

is held ﬁxed and the lower bound
L(q, θ) is maximized with respect
to the parameter vector θ to give
a revised value θnew. Because the
KL divergence is nonnegative, this
causes the log likelihood ln p(X|θ)
to increase by at least as much as
the lower bound does.

complete data) log likelihood function whose value we wish to maximize. We start
with some initial parameter value θold, and in the ﬁrst E step we evaluate the poste-
rior distribution over latent variables, which gives rise to a lower bound L(θ, θ(old))
whose value equals the log likelihood at θ(old), as shown by the blue curve. Note that
the bound makes a tangential contact with the log likelihood at θ(old), so that both
curves have the same gradient. This bound is a convex function having a unique
maximum (for mixture components from the exponential family). In the M step, the
bound is maximized giving the value θ(new), which gives a larger value of log likeli-
hood than θ(old). The subsequent E step then constructs a bound that is tangential at
θ(new) as shown by the green curve.
For the particular case of an independent, identically distributed data set, X
will comprise N data points {xn} while Z will comprise N corresponding latent
(cid:21)
variables {zn}, where n = 1, . . . , N. From the independence assumption, we have
n p(xn, zn) and, by marginalizing over the {zn} we have p(X) =
p(X, Z) =
n p(xn). Using the sum and product rules, we see that the posterior probability

(cid:21)

that is evaluated in the E step takes the form

(9.75)

and so the posterior distribution also factorizes with respect to n.
In the case of
the Gaussian mixture model this simply says that the responsibility that each of the
mixture components takes for a particular data point xn depends only on the value
of xn and on the parameters θ of the mixture components, not on the values of the
other data points.

We have seen that both the E and the M steps of the EM algorithm are increas-
ing the value of a well-deﬁned bound on the log likelihood function and that the

454

9. MIXTURE MODELS AND EM

complete EM cycle will change the model parameters in such a way as to cause
the log likelihood to increase (unless it is already at a maximum, in which case the
parameters remain unchanged).
We can also use the EM algorithm to maximize the posterior distribution p(θ|X)
for models in which we have introduced a prior p(θ) over the parameters. To see this,
we note that as a function of θ, we have p(θ|X) = p(θ, X)/p(X) and so

ln p(θ|X) = ln p(θ, X) − ln p(X).

Making use of the decomposition (9.70), we have

ln p(θ|X) = L(q, θ) + KL(q(cid:5)p) + ln p(θ) − ln p(X)

(cid:2) L(q, θ) + ln p(θ) − ln p(X).

(9.76)

(9.77)

where ln p(X) is a constant. We can again optimize the right-hand side alternately
with respect to q and θ. The optimization with respect to q gives rise to the same E-
step equations as for the standard EM algorithm, because q only appears in L(q, θ).
The M-step equations are modiﬁed through the introduction of the prior term ln p(θ),
which typically requires only a small modiﬁcation to the standard maximum likeli-
hood M-step equations.

The EM algorithm breaks down the potentially difﬁcult problem of maximizing
the likelihood function into two stages, the E step and the M step, each of which will
often prove simpler to implement. Nevertheless, for complex models it may be the
case that either the E step or the M step, or indeed both, remain intractable. This
leads to two possible extensions of the EM algorithm, as follows.
The generalized EM, or GEM, algorithm addresses the problem of an intractable
M step. Instead of aiming to maximize L(q, θ) with respect to θ, it seeks instead
to change the parameters in such a way as to increase its value. Again, because
L(q, θ) is a lower bound on the log likelihood function, each complete EM cycle of
the GEM algorithm is guaranteed to increase the value of the log likelihood (unless
the parameters already correspond to a local maximum). One way to exploit the
GEM approach would be to use one of the nonlinear optimization strategies, such
as the conjugate gradients algorithm, during the M step. Another form of GEM
algorithm, known as the expectation conditional maximization, or ECM, algorithm,
involves making several constrained optimizations within each M step (Meng and
Rubin, 1993). For instance, the parameters might be partitioned into groups, and the
M step is broken down into multiple steps each of which involves optimizing one of
the subset with the remainder held ﬁxed.
We can similarly generalize the E step of the EM algorithm by performing a
partial, rather than complete, optimization of L(q, θ) with respect to q(Z) (Neal and
Hinton, 1999). As we have seen, for any given value of θ there is a unique maximum
of L(q, θ) with respect to q(Z) that corresponds to the posterior distribution qθ(Z) =
p(Z|X, θ) and that for this choice of q(Z) the bound L(q, θ) is equal to the log
likelihood function ln p(X|θ). It follows that any algorithm that converges to the
global maximum of L(q, θ) will ﬁnd a value of θ that is also a global maximum
of the log likelihood ln p(X|θ). Provided p(X, Z|θ) is a continuous function of θ

Exercises

455

then, by continuity, any local maximum of L(q, θ) will also be a local maximum of
ln p(X|θ).
Consider the case of N independent data points x1, . . . , xN with corresponding
latent variables z1, . . . , zN . The joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) factorizes over the data
points, and this structure can be exploited in an incremental form of EM in which
at each EM cycle only one data point is processed at a time. In the E step, instead
of recomputing the responsibilities for all of the data points, we just re-evaluate the
responsibilities for one data point. It might appear that the subsequent M step would
require computation involving the responsibilities for all of the data points. How-
ever, if the mixture components are members of the exponential family, then the
responsibilities enter only through simple sufﬁcient statistics, and these can be up-
dated efﬁciently. Consider, for instance, the case of a Gaussian mixture, and suppose
we perform an update for data point m in which the corresponding old and new
values of the responsibilities are denoted γold(zmk) and γnew(zmk). In the M step,
the required sufﬁcient statistics can be updated incrementally. For instance, for the
means the sufﬁcient statistics are deﬁned by (9.17) and (9.18) from which we obtain

The corresponding results for the covariances and the mixing coefﬁcients are analo-
gous.

Thus both the E step and the M step take ﬁxed time that is independent of the
total number of data points. Because the parameters are revised after each data point,
rather than waiting until after the whole data set is processed, this incremental ver-
sion can converge faster than the batch version. Each E or M step in this incremental
algorithm is increasing the value of L(q, θ) and, as we have shown above, if the
algorithm converges to a local (or global) maximum of L(q, θ), this will correspond
to a local (or global) maximum of the log likelihood function ln p(X|θ).

Approximate

Inference

A central task in the application of probabilistic models is the evaluation of the pos-
terior distribution p(Z|X) of the latent variables Z given the observed (visible) data
variables X, and the evaluation of expectations computed with respect to this dis-
tribution. The model might also contain some deterministic parameters, which we
will leave implicit for the moment, or it may be a fully Bayesian model in which any
unknown parameters are given prior distributions and are absorbed into the set of
latent variables denoted by the vector Z. For instance, in the EM algorithm we need
to evaluate the expectation of the complete-data log likelihood with respect to the
posterior distribution of the latent variables. For many models of practical interest, it
will be infeasible to evaluate the posterior distribution or indeed to compute expec-
tations with respect to this distribution. This could be because the dimensionality of
the latent space is too high to work with directly or because the posterior distribution
has a highly complex form for which expectations are not analytically tractable. In
the case of continuous variables, the required integrations may not have closed-form

461

10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE

analytical solutions, while the dimensionality of the space and the complexity of the
integrand may prohibit numerical integration. For discrete variables, the marginal-
izations involve summing over all possible conﬁgurations of the hidden variables,
and though this is always possible in principle, we often ﬁnd in practice that there
may be exponentially many hidden states so that exact calculation is prohibitively
expensive.

In such situations, we need to resort to approximation schemes, and these fall
broadly into two classes, according to whether they rely on stochastic or determin-
istic approximations. Stochastic techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, de-
scribed in Chapter 11, have enabled the widespread use of Bayesian methods across
many domains. They generally have the property that given inﬁnite computational
resource, they can generate exact results, and the approximation arises from the use
of a ﬁnite amount of processor time. In practice, sampling methods can be compu-
tationally demanding, often limiting their use to small-scale problems. Also, it can
be difﬁcult to know whether a sampling scheme is generating independent samples
from the required distribution.

In this chapter, we introduce a range of deterministic approximation schemes,
some of which scale well to large applications. These are based on analytical ap-
proximations to the posterior distribution, for example by assuming that it factorizes
in a particular way or that it has a speciﬁc parametric form such as a Gaussian. As
such, they can never generate exact results, and so their strengths and weaknesses
are complementary to those of sampling methods.

In Section 4.4, we discussed the Laplace approximation, which is based on a
local Gaussian approximation to a mode (i.e., a maximum) of the distribution. Here
we turn to a family of approximation techniques called variational inference or vari-
ational Bayes, which use more global criteria and which have been widely applied.
We conclude with a brief introduction to an alternative variational framework known
as expectation propagation.

10.1. Variational Inference

Variational methods have their origins in the 18th century with the work of Euler,
Lagrange, and others on the calculus of variations. Standard calculus is concerned
with ﬁnding derivatives of functions. We can think of a function as a mapping that
takes the value of a variable as the input and returns the value of the function as the
output. The derivative of the function then describes how the output value varies
as we make inﬁnitesimal changes to the input value. Similarly, we can deﬁne a
functional as a mapping that takes a function as the input and that returns the value
of the functional as the output. An example would be the entropy H[p], which takes
a probability distribution p(x) as the input and returns the quantity

(cid:6)

H[p] =

p(x) ln p(x) dx

(10.1)

10.1. Variational Inference

463

as the output. We can the introduce the concept of a functional derivative, which ex-
presses how the value of the functional changes in response to inﬁnitesimal changes
to the input function (Feynman et al., 1964). The rules for the calculus of variations
mirror those of standard calculus and are discussed in Appendix D. Many problems
can be expressed in terms of an optimization problem in which the quantity being
optimized is a functional. The solution is obtained by exploring all possible input
functions to ﬁnd the one that maximizes, or minimizes, the functional. Variational
methods have broad applicability and include such areas as ﬁnite element methods
(Kapur, 1989) and maximum entropy (Schwarz, 1988).

Although there is nothing intrinsically approximate about variational methods,
they do naturally lend themselves to ﬁnding approximate solutions. This is done
by restricting the range of functions over which the optimization is performed, for
instance by considering only quadratic functions or by considering functions com-
posed of a linear combination of ﬁxed basis functions in which only the coefﬁcients
of the linear combination can vary. In the case of applications to probabilistic in-
ference, the restriction may for example take the form of factorization assumptions
(Jordan et al., 1999; Jaakkola, 2001).

Now let us consider in more detail how the concept of variational optimization
can be applied to the inference problem. Suppose we have a fully Bayesian model in
which all parameters are given prior distributions. The model may also have latent
variables as well as parameters, and we shall denote the set of all latent variables
and parameters by Z. Similarly, we denote the set of all observed variables by X.
For example, we might have a set of N independent, identically distributed data,
for which X = {x1, . . . , xN} and Z = {z1, . . . , zN}. Our probabilistic model
speciﬁes the joint distribution p(X, Z), and our goal is to ﬁnd an approximation for
the posterior distribution p(Z|X) as well as for the model evidence p(X). As in our
discussion of EM, we can decompose the log marginal probability using

ln p(X) = L(q) + KL(q(cid:5)p)

(cid:6)

(cid:12)

where we have deﬁned

L(q) =

KL(q(cid:5)p) = −

q(Z) ln

(10.2)

(10.3)

(10.4)

This differs from our discussion of EM only in that the parameter vector θ no longer
appears, because the parameters are now stochastic variables and are absorbed into
Z. Since in this chapter we will mainly be interested in continuous variables we have
used integrations rather than summations in formulating this decomposition. How-
ever, the analysis goes through unchanged if some or all of the variables are discrete
simply by replacing the integrations with summations as required. As before, we
can maximize the lower bound L(q) by optimization with respect to the distribution
q(Z), which is equivalent to minimizing the KL divergence. If we allow any possible
choice for q(Z), then the maximum of the lower bound occurs when the KL diver-
gence vanishes, which occurs when q(Z) equals the posterior distribution p(Z|X).

Figure 10.1 Illustration of the variational approximation for the example considered earlier in Figure 4.14. The
left-hand plot shows the original distribution (yellow) along with the Laplace (red) and variational (green) approx-
imations, and the right-hand plot shows the negative logarithms of the corresponding curves.

However, we shall suppose the model is such that working with the true posterior
distribution is intractable.

We therefore consider instead a restricted family of distributions q(Z) and then
seek the member of this family for which the KL divergence is minimized. Our goal
is to restrict the family sufﬁciently that they comprise only tractable distributions,
while at the same time allowing the family to be sufﬁciently rich and ﬂexible that it
can provide a good approximation to the true posterior distribution. It is important to
emphasize that the restriction is imposed purely to achieve tractability, and that sub-
ject to this requirement we should use as rich a family of approximating distributions
as possible. In particular, there is no ‘over-ﬁtting’ associated with highly ﬂexible dis-
tributions. Using more ﬂexible approximations simply allows us to approach the true
posterior distribution more closely.
One way to restrict the family of approximating distributions is to use a paramet-
ric distribution q(Z|ω) governed by a set of parameters ω. The lower bound L(q)
then becomes a function of ω, and we can exploit standard nonlinear optimization
techniques to determine the optimal values for the parameters. An example of this
approach, in which the variational distribution is a Gaussian and we have optimized
with respect to its mean and variance, is shown in Figure 10.1.

10.1.1 Factorized distributions
Here we consider an alternative way in which to restrict the family of distri-
butions q(Z). Suppose we partition the elements of Z into disjoint groups that we
denote by Zi where i = 1, . . . , M. We then assume that the q distribution factorizes
with respect to these groups, so that

M(cid:14)

i=1

q(Z) =

qi(Zi).

(10.5)

10.1. Variational Inference

465

It should be emphasized that we are making no further assumptions about the distri-
bution. In particular, we place no restriction on the functional forms of the individual
factors qi(Zi). This factorized form of variational inference corresponds to an ap-
proximation framework developed in physics called mean ﬁeld theory (Parisi, 1988).
Amongst all distributions q(Z) having the form (10.5), we now seek that distri-
bution for which the lower bound L(q) is largest. We therefore wish to make a free
form (variational) optimization of L(q) with respect to all of the distributions qi(Zi),
which we do by optimizing with respect to each of the factors in turn. To achieve
this, we ﬁrst substitute (10.5) into (10.3) and then dissect out the dependence on one
of the factors qj(Zj). Denoting qj(Zj) by simply qj to keep the notation uncluttered,
we then obtain
L(q) =

ln(cid:4)p(X, Zj) = Ei(cid:9)=j[ln p(X, Z)] + const.

(10.7)
Here the notation Ei(cid:9)=j[··· ] denotes an expectation with respect to the q distributions
over all variables zi for i (cid:9)= j, so that

Now suppose we keep the {qi(cid:9)=j} ﬁxed and maximize L(q) in (10.6) with re-
spect to all possible forms for the distribution qj(Zj). This is easily done by rec-
ognizing that (10.6) is a negative Kullback-Leibler divergence between qj(Zj) and

(cid:4)p(X, Zj). Thus maximizing (10.6) is equivalent to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler

Leonhard Euler

Euler was a Swiss mathematician
and physicist who worked in St.
Petersburg and Berlin and who is
widely considered to be one of the
greatest mathematicians of all time.
He is certainly the most proliﬁc, and
his collected works ﬁll 75 volumes. Amongst his many

contributions, he formulated the modern theory of the
function, he developed (together with Lagrange) the
calculus of variations, and he discovered the formula
eiπ = −1, which relates four of the most important
numbers in mathematics. During the last 17 years of
his life, he was almost totally blind, and yet he pro-
duced nearly half of his results during this period.

divergence, and the minimum occurs when qj(Zj) =(cid:4)p(X, Zj). Thus we obtain a

general expression for the optimal solution q(cid:1)

j (Zj) given by

ln q(cid:1)

j (Zj) = Ei(cid:9)=j[ln p(X, Z)] + const.

(10.9)

It is worth taking a few moments to study the form of this solution as it provides the
basis for applications of variational methods. It says that the log of the optimal so-
lution for factor qj is obtained simply by considering the log of the joint distribution
over all hidden and visible variables and then taking the expectation with respect to
all of the other factors {qi} for i (cid:9)= j.
(cid:6)

The additive constant in (10.9) is set by normalizing the distribution q(cid:1)

Thus if we take the exponential of both sides and normalize, we have

exp (Ei(cid:9)=j[ln p(X, Z)])

j (Zj).

q(cid:1)
j (Zj) =

.

exp (Ei(cid:9)=j[ln p(X, Z)]) dZj

In practice, we shall ﬁnd it more convenient to work with the form (10.9) and then re-
instate the normalization constant (where required) by inspection. This will become
clear from subsequent examples.

The set of equations given by (10.9) for j = 1, . . . , M represent a set of con-
sistency conditions for the maximum of the lower bound subject to the factorization
constraint. However, they do not represent an explicit solution because the expres-
sion on the right-hand side of (10.9) for the optimum q(cid:1)
j (Zj) depends on expectations
computed with respect to the other factors qi(Zi) for i (cid:9)= j. We will therefore seek
a consistent solution by ﬁrst initializing all of the factors qi(Zi) appropriately and
then cycling through the factors and replacing each in turn with a revised estimate
given by the right-hand side of (10.9) evaluated using the current estimates for all of
the other factors. Convergence is guaranteed because bound is convex with respect
to each of the factors qi(Zi) (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004).

10.1.2 Properties of factorized approximations
Our approach to variational inference is based on a factorized approximation to
the true posterior distribution. Let us consider for a moment the problem of approx-
imating a general distribution by a factorized distribution. To begin with, we discuss
the problem of approximating a Gaussian distribution using a factorized Gaussian,
which will provide useful insight into the types of inaccuracy introduced in using
factorized approximations. Consider a Gaussian distribution p(z) = N (z|µ, Λ
−1)
over two correlated variables z = (z1, z2) in which the mean and precision have
elements

and Λ21 = Λ12 due to the symmetry of the precision matrix. Now suppose we
wish to approximate this distribution using a factorized Gaussian of the form q(z) =
q1(z1)q2(z2). We ﬁrst apply the general result (10.9) to ﬁnd an expression for the

10.1. Variational Inference

467

optimal factor q(cid:1)
1(z1). In doing so it is useful to note that on the right-hand side we
only need to retain those terms that have some functional dependence on z1 because
all other terms can be absorbed into the normalization constant. Thus we have

ln q(cid:1)

1(z1) = Ez2[ln p(z)] + const

+ const

(10.11)

Next we observe that the right-hand side of this expression is a quadratic function of
z1, and so we can identify q(cid:1)(z1) as a Gaussian distribution. It is worth emphasizing
that we did not assume that q(zi) is Gaussian, but rather we derived this result by
variational optimization of the KL divergence over all possible distributions q(zi).
Note also that we do not need to consider the additive constant in (10.9) explicitly
because it represents the normalization constant that can be found at the end by
inspection if required. Using the technique of completing the square, we can identify
the mean and precision of this Gaussian, giving

Section 2.3.1

q(cid:1)(z1) = N (z1|m1, Λ−1
11 )

where

m1 = µ1 − Λ−1

11 Λ12 (E[z2] − µ2) .
2(z2) is also Gaussian and can be written as

By symmetry, q(cid:1)

2(z2) = N (z2|m2, Λ−1
q(cid:1)
22 )

(10.12)

(10.13)

(10.14)

in which

m2 = µ2 − Λ−1

22 Λ21 (E[z1] − µ1) .

(10.15)
Note that these solutions are coupled, so that q(cid:1)(z1) depends on expectations com-
puted with respect to q(cid:1)(z2) and vice versa. In general, we address this by treating
the variational solutions as re-estimation equations and cycling through the variables
in turn updating them until some convergence criterion is satisﬁed. We shall see
an example of this shortly. Here, however, we note that the problem is sufﬁciently
simple that a closed form solution can be found. In particular, because E[z1] = m1
and E[z2] = m2, we see that the two equations are satisﬁed if we take E[z1] = µ1
and E[z2] = µ2, and it is easily shown that this is the only solution provided the dis-
tribution is nonsingular. This result is illustrated in Figure 10.2(a). We see that the
mean is correctly captured but that the variance of q(z) is controlled by the direction
of smallest variance of p(z), and that the variance along the orthogonal direction is
signiﬁcantly under-estimated. It is a general result that a factorized variational ap-
proximation tends to give approximations to the posterior distribution that are too
compact.
By way of comparison, suppose instead that we had been minimizing the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(p(cid:5)q). As we shall see, this form of KL divergence

is used in an alternative approximate inference framework called expectation prop-

where the constant term is simply the entropy of p(Z) and so does not depend on

easily done using a Lagrange multiplier to give

q(cid:1)
j (Zj) =

p(Z)

dZi = p(Zj).

(10.17)

In this case, we ﬁnd that the optimal solution for qj(Zj) is just given by the corre-
sponding marginal distribution of p(Z). Note that this is a closed-form solution and
so does not require iteration.

To apply this result to the illustrative example of a Gaussian distribution p(z)
over a vector z we can use (2.98), which gives the result shown in Figure 10.2(b).
We see that once again the mean of the approximation is correct, but that it places
signiﬁcant probability mass in regions of variable space that have very low probabil-
ity.

The difference between these two results can be understood by noting that there

from regions of Z space in which p(Z) is near zero unless q(Z) is also close to
zero. Thus minimizing this form of KL divergence leads to distributions q(Z) that
avoid regions in which p(Z) is small. Conversely, the Kullback-Leibler divergence
KL(p(cid:5)q) is minimized by distributions q(Z) that are nonzero in regions where p(Z)
is nonzero.

We can gain further insight into the different behaviour of the two KL diver-
gences if we consider approximating a multimodal distribution by a unimodal one,
as illustrated in Figure 10.3.
In practical applications, the true posterior distri-
bution will often be multimodal, with most of the posterior mass concentrated in
some number of relatively small regions of parameter space. These multiple modes
may arise through nonidentiﬁability in the latent space or through complex nonlin-
ear dependence on the parameters. Both types of multimodality were encountered in
Chapter 9 in the context of Gaussian mixtures, where they manifested themselves as
multiple maxima in the likelihood function, and a variational treatment based on the
minimization of KL(q(cid:5)p) will tend to ﬁnd one of these modes. By contrast, if we
were to minimize KL(p(cid:5)q), the resulting approximations would average across all
of the modes and, in the context of the mixture model, would lead to poor predictive
distributions (because the average of two good parameter values is typically itself
not a good parameter value). It is possible to make use of KL(p(cid:5)q) to deﬁne a useful
inference procedure, but this requires a rather different approach to the one discussed
here, and will be considered in detail when we discuss expectation propagation.

The two forms of Kullback-Leibler divergence are members of the alpha family

where −∞ < α < ∞ is a continuous parameter. The Kullback-Leibler divergence
KL(p(cid:5)q) corresponds to the limit α → 1, whereas KL(q(cid:5)p) corresponds to the limit
α → −1. For all values of α we have Dα(p(cid:5)q) (cid:2) 0, with equality if, and only if,
p(x) = q(x). Suppose p(x) is a ﬁxed distribution, and we minimize Dα(p(cid:5)q) with
respect to some set of distributions q(x). Then for α (cid:1) −1 the divergence is zero
forcing, so that any values of x for which p(x) = 0 will have q(x) = 0, and typically
q(x) will under-estimate the support of p(x) and will tend to seek the mode with the
largest mass. Conversely for α (cid:2) 1 the divergence is zero-avoiding, so that values
of x for which p(x) > 0 will have q(x) > 0, and typically q(x) will stretch to cover
all of p(x), and will over-estimate the support of p(x). When α = 0 we obtain a
symmetric divergence that is linearly related to the Hellinger distance given by

10.1.3 Example: The univariate Gaussian
We now illustrate the factorized variational approximation using a Gaussian dis-
tribution over a single variable x (MacKay, 2003). Our goal is to infer the posterior
distribution for the mean µ and precision τ , given a data set D = {x1, . . . , xN} of
observed values of x which are assumed to be drawn independently from the Gaus-
sian. The likelihood function is given by

where Gam(τ|a0, b0) is the gamma distribution deﬁned by (2.146). Together these
distributions constitute a Gaussian-Gamma conjugate prior distribution.

p(τ) = Gam(τ|a0, b0)

For this simple problem the posterior distribution can be found exactly, and again
takes the form of a Gaussian-gamma distribution. However, for tutorial purposes
we will consider a factorized variational approximation to the posterior distribution
given by

q(µ, τ) = qµ(µ)qτ (τ).

factors qµ(µ) and qτ (τ) can be obtained from the general result (10.9) as follows.
For qµ(µ) we have

ln q(cid:1)

µ(µ) = Eτ [ln p(D|µ, τ) + ln p(µ|τ)] + const

(10.26)

(10.27)
Note that for N → ∞ this gives the maximum likelihood result in which µN = x
and the precision is inﬁnite.

Similarly, the optimal solution for the factor qτ (τ) is given by

τ (τ) = Eµ [ln p(D|µ, τ) + ln p(µ|τ)] + ln p(τ) + const

Again this exhibits the expected behaviour when N → ∞.

It should be emphasized that we did not assume these speciﬁc functional forms
for the optimal distributions qµ(µ) and qτ (τ). They arose naturally from the structure
of the likelihood function and the corresponding conjugate priors.

Thus we have expressions for the optimal distributions qµ(µ) and qτ (τ) each of
which depends on moments evaluated with respect to the other distribution. One ap-
proach to ﬁnding a solution is therefore to make an initial guess for, say, the moment
E[τ] and use this to re-compute the distribution qµ(µ). Given this revised distri-
bution we can then extract the required moments E[µ] and E[µ2], and use these to
recompute the distribution qτ (τ), and so on. Since the space of hidden variables for
this example is only two dimensional, we can illustrate the variational approxima-
tion to the posterior distribution by plotting contours of both the true posterior and
the factorized approximation, as illustrated in Figure 10.4.

Appendix B

In general, we will need to use an iterative approach such as this in order to
solve for the optimal factorized posterior distribution. For the very simple example
we are considering here, however, we can ﬁnd an explicit solution by solving the
simultaneous equations for the optimal factors qµ(µ) and qτ (τ). Before doing this,
we can simplify these expressions by considering broad, noninformative priors in
which µ0 = a0 = b0 = λ0 = 0. Although these parameter settings correspond to
improper priors, we see that the posterior distribution is still well deﬁned. Using the
standard result E[τ] = aN /bN for the mean of a gamma distribution, together with
(10.29) and (10.30), we have

We recognize the right-hand side as the familiar unbiased estimator for the variance
of a univariate Gaussian distribution, and so we see that the use of a Bayesian ap-
proach has avoided the bias of the maximum likelihood solution.

10.1.4 Model comparison
As well as performing inference over the hidden variables Z, we may also
wish to compare a set of candidate models, labelled by the index m, and having
prior probabilities p(m). Our goal is then to approximate the posterior probabilities
p(m|X), where X is the observed data. This is a slightly more complex situation
than that considered so far because different models may have different structure
and indeed different dimensionality for the hidden variables Z. We cannot there-
fore simply consider a factorized approximation q(Z)q(m), but must instead recog-
nize that the posterior over Z must be conditioned on m, and so we must consider
q(Z, m) = q(Z|m)q(m). We can readily verify the following decomposition based
on this variational distribution

p(Z, m|X)
q(Z|m)q(m)

q(Z|m)q(m)

Here we are assuming discrete Z, but the same analysis applies to continuous latent
variables provided the summations are replaced with integrations. We can maximize
Lm with respect to the distribution q(m) using a Lagrange multiplier, with the result

q(m) ∝ p(m) exp{Lm}.

(10.36)
However, if we maximize Lm with respect to the q(Z|m), we ﬁnd that the solutions
for different m are coupled, as we expect because they are conditioned on m. We
proceed instead by ﬁrst optimizing each of the q(Z|m) individually by optimization

of (10.35), and then subsequently determining the q(m) using (10.36). After nor-
malization the resulting values for q(m) can be used for model selection or model
averaging in the usual way.

10.2.

Illustration: Variational Mixture of Gaussians

We now return to our discussion of the Gaussian mixture model and apply the vari-
ational inference machinery developed in the previous section. This will provide a
good illustration of the application of variational methods and will also demonstrate
how a Bayesian treatment elegantly resolves many of the difﬁculties associated with
the maximum likelihood approach (Attias, 1999b). The reader is encouraged to work
through this example in detail as it provides many insights into the practical appli-
cation of variational methods. Many Bayesian models, corresponding to much more
sophisticated distributions, can be solved by straightforward extensions and general-
izations of this analysis.

Our starting point is the likelihood function for the Gaussian mixture model, il-
lustrated by the graphical model in Figure 9.6. For each observation xn we have
a corresponding latent variable zn comprising a 1-of-K binary vector with ele-
ments znk for k = 1, . . . , K. As before we denote the observed data set by X =
{x1, . . . , xN}, and similarly we denote the latent variables by Z = {z1, . . . , zN}.
From (9.10) we can write down the conditional distribution of Z, given the mixing
coefﬁcients π, in the form

p(Z|π) =

πznk

Similarly, from (9.11), we can write down the conditional distribution of the ob-
served data vectors, given the latent variables and the component parameters

p(X|Z, µ, Λ) =

(10.38)

where µ = {µk} and Λ = {Λk}. Note that we are working in terms of precision
matrices rather than covariance matrices as this somewhat simpliﬁes the mathemat-
ics.

Next we introduce priors over the parameters µ, Λ and π. The analysis is con-
siderably simpliﬁed if we use conjugate prior distributions. We therefore choose a
Dirichlet distribution over the mixing coefﬁcients π

p(π) = Dir(π|α0) = C(α0)

(10.39)

by (B.23). As we have seen, the parameter α0 can be interpreted as the effective
prior number of observations associated with each component of the mixture. If the
value of α0 is small, then the posterior distribution will be inﬂuenced primarily by
the data rather than by the prior.

Similarly, we introduce an independent Gaussian-Wishart prior governing the

mean and precision of each Gaussian component, given by

p(µ, Λ) = p(µ|Λ)p(Λ)

because this represents the conjugate prior distribution when both the mean and pre-
cision are unknown. Typically we would choose m0 = 0 by symmetry.

The resulting model can be represented as a directed graph as shown in Fig-
ure 10.5. Note that there is a link from Λ to µ since the variance of the distribution
over µ in (10.40) is a function of Λ.

This example provides a nice illustration of the distinction between latent vari-
ables and parameters. Variables such as zn that appear inside the plate are regarded
as latent variables because the number of such variables grows with the size of the
data set. By contrast, variables such as µ that are outside the plate are ﬁxed in
number independently of the size of the data set, and so are regarded as parameters.
From the perspective of graphical models, however, there is really no fundamental
difference between them.

10.2.1 Variational distribution
In order to formulate a variational treatment of this model, we next write down

the joint distribution of all of the random variables, which is given by
p(X, Z, π, µ, Λ) = p(X|Z, µ, Λ)p(Z|π)p(π)p(µ|Λ)p(Λ)

(10.41)

in which the various factors are deﬁned above. The reader should take a moment to
verify that this decomposition does indeed correspond to the probabilistic graphical
model shown in Figure 10.5. Note that only the variables X = {x1, . . . , xN} are
observed.

476

10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE

We now consider a variational distribution which factorizes between the latent

variables and the parameters so that

q(Z, π, µ, Λ) = q(Z)q(π, µ, Λ).

(10.42)

It is remarkable that this is the only assumption that we need to make in order to
obtain a tractable practical solution to our Bayesian mixture model. In particular, the
functional form of the factors q(Z) and q(π, µ, Λ) will be determined automatically
by optimization of the variational distribution. Note that we are omitting the sub-
scripts on the q distributions, much as we do with the p distributions in (10.41), and
are relying on the arguments to distinguish the different distributions.

The corresponding sequential update equations for these factors can be easily
derived by making use of the general result (10.9). Let us consider the derivation of
the update equation for the factor q(Z). The log of the optimized factor is given by

ln q(cid:1)(Z) = Eπ,µ,Λ[ln p(X, Z, π, µ, Λ)] + const.

(10.43)

We now make use of the decomposition (10.41). Note that we are only interested in
the functional dependence of the right-hand side on the variable Z. Thus any terms
that do not depend on Z can be absorbed into the additive normalization constant,
giving

ln q(cid:1)(Z) = Eπ[ln p(Z|π)] + Eµ,Λ[ln p(X|Z, µ, Λ)] + const.

(10.44)

Substituting for the two conditional distributions on the right-hand side, and again
absorbing any terms that are independent of Z into the additive constant, we have

ln q(cid:1)(Z) =

We see that the optimal solution for the factor q(Z) takes the same functional form
as the prior p(Z|π). Note that because ρnk is given by the exponential of a real
quantity, the quantities rnk will be nonnegative and will sum to one, as required.

For the discrete distribution q(cid:1)(Z) we have the standard result

E[znk] = rnk

(10.50)

from which we see that the quantities rnk are playing the role of responsibilities.
Note that the optimal solution for q(cid:1)(Z) depends on moments evaluated with respect
to the distributions of other variables, and so again the variational update equations
are coupled and must be solved iteratively.

At this point, we shall ﬁnd it convenient to deﬁne three statistics of the observed

data set evaluated with respect to the responsibilities, given by

We observe that the right-hand side of this expression decomposes into a sum of
terms involving only π together with terms only involving µ and Λ, which implies
that the variational posterior q(π, µ, Λ) factorizes to give q(π)q(µ, Λ). Further-
more, the terms involving µ and Λ themselves comprise a sum over k of terms
involving µk and Λk leading to the further factorization

q(π, µ, Λ) = q(π)

Exercise 10.14

where α has components αk given by

(10.58)
Finally, the variational posterior distribution q(cid:1)(µk, Λk) does not factorize into
the product of the marginals, but we can always use the product rule to write it in the
form q(cid:1)(µk, Λk) = q(cid:1)(µk|Λk)q(cid:1)(Λk). The two factors can be found by inspecting
(10.54) and reading off those terms that involve µk and Λk. The result, as expected,
is a Gaussian-Wishart distribution and is given by
µk|mk, (βkΛk)−1

These update equations are analogous to the M-step equations of the EM algorithm
for the maximum likelihood solution of the mixture of Gaussians. We see that the
computations that must be performed in order to update the variational posterior
distribution over the model parameters involve evaluation of the same sums over the
data set, as arose in the maximum likelihood treatment.

In order to perform this variational M step, we need the expectations E[znk] =
rnk representing the responsibilities. These are obtained by normalizing the ρnk that
are given by (10.46). We see that this expression involves expectations with respect
to the variational distributions of the parameters, and these are easily evaluated to

rnk ∝ πk|Λk|1/2 exp

(10.68)

where we have used the precision in place of the covariance to highlight the similarity
to (10.67).

Thus the optimization of the variational posterior distribution involves cycling
between two stages analogous to the E and M steps of the maximum likelihood EM
algorithm. In the variational equivalent of the E step, we use the current distributions
over the model parameters to evaluate the moments in (10.64), (10.65), and (10.66)
and hence evaluate E[znk] = rnk. Then in the subsequent variational equivalent
of the M step, we keep these responsibilities ﬁxed and use them to re-compute the
variational distribution over the parameters using (10.57) and (10.59). In each case,
we see that the variational posterior distribution has the same functional form as the
corresponding factor in the joint distribution (10.41). This is a general result and is
a consequence of the choice of conjugate distributions.

Figure 10.6 shows the results of applying this approach to the rescaled Old Faith-
ful data set for a Gaussian mixture model having K = 6 components. We see that
after convergence, there are only two components for which the expected values
of the mixing coefﬁcients are numerically distinguishable from their prior values.
This effect can be understood qualitatively in terms of the automatic trade-off in a
Bayesian model between ﬁtting the data and the complexity of the model, in which
the complexity penalty arises from components whose parameters are pushed away
from their prior values. Components that take essentially no responsibility for ex-
plaining the data points have rnk (cid:7) 0 and hence Nk (cid:7) 0. From (10.58), we see
that αk (cid:7) α0 and from (10.60)–(10.63) we see that the other parameters revert to
their prior values. In principle such components are ﬁtted slightly to the data points,
but for broad priors this effect is too small to be seen numerically. For the varia-
tional Gaussian mixture model the expected values of the mixing coefﬁcients in the
posterior distribution are given by

the prior tightly constrains the mixing coefﬁcients so that α0 → ∞, then E[πk] →
1/K.

In Figure 10.6, the prior over the mixing coefﬁcients is a Dirichlet of the form
(10.39). Recall from Figure 2.5 that for α0 < 1 the prior favours solutions in which
some of the mixing coefﬁcients are zero. Figure 10.6 was obtained using α0 = 10−3,
and resulted in two components having nonzero mixing coefﬁcients. If instead we
choose α0 = 1 we obtain three components with nonzero mixing coefﬁcients, and
for α = 10 all six components have nonzero mixing coefﬁcients.

As we have seen there is a close similarity between the variational solution for
the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians and the EM algorithm for maximum likelihood.
In fact if we consider the limit N → ∞ then the Bayesian treatment converges to the
maximum likelihood EM algorithm. For anything other than very small data sets,
the dominant computational cost of the variational algorithm for Gaussian mixtures
arises from the evaluation of the responsibilities, together with the evaluation and
inversion of the weighted data covariance matrices. These computations mirror pre-
cisely those that arise in the maximum likelihood EM algorithm, and so there is little
computational overhead in using this Bayesian approach as compared to the tradi-
tional maximum likelihood one. There are, however, some substantial advantages.
First of all, the singularities that arise in maximum likelihood when a Gaussian com-
ponent ‘collapses’ onto a speciﬁc data point are absent in the Bayesian treatment.

10.2. Illustration: Variational Mixture of Gaussians

481

Indeed, these singularities are removed if we simply introduce a prior and then use a
MAP estimate instead of maximum likelihood. Furthermore, there is no over-ﬁtting
if we choose a large number K of components in the mixture, as we saw in Fig-
ure 10.6. Finally, the variational treatment opens up the possibility of determining
the optimal number of components in the mixture without resorting to techniques
such as cross validation.

Section 10.2.4

10.2.2 Variational lower bound
We can also straightforwardly evaluate the lower bound (10.3) for this model.
In practice, it is useful to be able to monitor the bound during the re-estimation in
order to test for convergence. It can also provide a valuable check on both the math-
ematical expressions for the solutions and their software implementation, because at
each step of the iterative re-estimation procedure the value of this bound should not
decrease. We can take this a stage further to provide a deeper test of the correctness
of both the mathematical derivation of the update equations and of their software im-
plementation by using ﬁnite differences to check that each update does indeed give
a (constrained) maximum of the bound (Svens´en and Bishop, 2004).

and (B.79), respectively. Note that the terms involving expectations of the logs of the
q distributions simply represent the negative entropies of those distributions. Some
simpliﬁcations and combination of terms can be performed when these expressions
are summed to give the lower bound. However, we have kept the expressions sepa-
rate for ease of understanding.

Finally, it is worth noting that the lower bound provides an alternative approach
for deriving the variational re-estimation equations obtained in Section 10.2.1. To do
this we use the fact that, since the model has conjugate priors, the functional form of
the factors in the variational posterior distribution is known, namely discrete for Z,
Dirichlet for π, and Gaussian-Wishart for (µk, Λk). By taking general parametric
forms for these distributions we can derive the form of the lower bound as a function
of the parameters of the distributions. Maximizing the bound with respect to these
parameters then gives the required re-estimation equations.

10.2.3 Predictive density
In applications of the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians model we will often be

interested in the predictive density for a new value(cid:1)x of the observed variable. As-
sociated with this observation will be a corresponding latent variable(cid:1)z, and the pre-

Exercise 10.21

10.2.4 Determining the number of components
We have seen that the variational lower bound can be used to determine a pos-
terior distribution over the number K of components in the mixture model. There
is, however, one subtlety that needs to be addressed. For any given setting of the
parameters in a Gaussian mixture model (except for speciﬁc degenerate settings),
there will exist other parameter settings for which the density over the observed vari-
ables will be identical. These parameter values differ only through a re-labelling of
the components. For instance, consider a mixture of two Gaussians and a single ob-
served variable x, in which the parameters have the values π1 = a, π2 = b, µ1 = c,
µ2 = d, σ1 = e, σ2 = f. Then the parameter values π1 = b, π2 = a, µ1 = d,
µ2 = c, σ1 = f, σ2 = e, in which the two components have been exchanged, will
by symmetry give rise to the same value of p(x). If we have a mixture model com-
prising K components, then each parameter setting will be a member of a family of
K! equivalent settings.

In the context of maximum likelihood, this redundancy is irrelevant because the
parameter optimization algorithm (for example EM) will, depending on the initial-
ization of the parameters, ﬁnd one speciﬁc solution, and the other equivalent solu-
tions play no role. In a Bayesian setting, however, we marginalize over all possible

parameter values. We have seen in Figure 10.2 that if the true posterior distribution
is multimodal, variational inference based on the minimization of KL(q(cid:5)p) will tend
to approximate the distribution in the neighbourhood of one of the modes and ignore
the others. Again, because equivalent modes have equivalent predictive densities,
this is of no concern provided we are considering a model having a speciﬁc number
K of components. If, however, we wish to compare different values of K, then we
need to take account of this multimodality. A simple approximate solution is to add
a term ln K! onto the lower bound when used for model comparison and averaging.
Figure 10.7 shows a plot of the lower bound, including the multimodality fac-
tor, versus the number K of components for the Old Faithful data set. It is worth
emphasizing once again that maximum likelihood would lead to values of the likeli-
hood function that increase monotonically with K (assuming the singular solutions
have been avoided, and discounting the effects of local maxima) and so cannot be
used to determine an appropriate model complexity. By contrast, Bayesian inference
automatically makes the trade-off between model complexity and ﬁtting the data.

This approach to the determination of K requires that a range of models having
different K values be trained and compared. An alternative approach to determining
a suitable value for K is to treat the mixing coefﬁcients π as parameters and make
point estimates of their values by maximizing the lower bound (Corduneanu and
Bishop, 2001) with respect to π instead of maintaining a probability distribution
over them as in the fully Bayesian approach. This leads to the re-estimation equation

and this maximization is interleaved with the variational updates for the q distribution
over the remaining parameters. Components that provide insufﬁcient contribution

to explaining the data will have their mixing coefﬁcients driven to zero during the
optimization, and so they are effectively removed from the model through automatic
relevance determination. This allows us to make a single training run in which we
start with a relatively large initial value of K, and allow surplus components to be
pruned out of the model. The origins of the sparsity when optimizing with respect to
hyperparameters is discussed in detail in the context of the relevance vector machine.

10.2.5 Induced factorizations
In deriving these variational update equations for the Gaussian mixture model,
we assumed a particular factorization of the variational posterior distribution given
by (10.42). However, the optimal solutions for the various factors exhibit additional
factorizations. In particular, the solution for q(cid:1)(µ, Λ) is given by the product of an
independent distribution q(cid:1)(µk, Λk) over each of the components k of the mixture,
whereas the variational posterior distribution q(cid:1)(Z) over the latent variables, given
by (10.48), factorizes into an independent distribution q(cid:1)(zn) for each observation n
(note that it does not further factorize with respect to k because, for each value of n,
the znk are constrained to sum to one over k). These additional factorizations are a
consequence of the interaction between the assumed factorization and the conditional
independence properties of the true distribution, as characterized by the directed
graph in Figure 10.5.

We shall refer to these additional factorizations as induced factorizations be-
cause they arise from an interaction between the factorization assumed in the varia-
tional posterior distribution and the conditional independence properties of the true
joint distribution. In a numerical implementation of the variational approach it is
important to take account of such additional factorizations. For instance, it would
be very inefﬁcient to maintain a full precision matrix for the Gaussian distribution
over a set of variables if the optimal form for that distribution always had a diago-
nal precision matrix (corresponding to a factorization with respect to the individual
variables described by that Gaussian).

Such induced factorizations can easily be detected using a simple graphical test
based on d-separation as follows. We partition the latent variables into three disjoint
groups A, B, C and then let us suppose that we are assuming a factorization between
C and the remaining latent variables, so that

q(A, B, C) = q(A, B)q(C).

(10.84)

Using the general result (10.9), together with the product rule for probabilities, we
see that the optimal solution for q(A, B) is given by

ln q(cid:1)(A, B) = EC[ln p(X, A, B, C)] + const
= EC[ln p(A, B|X, C)] + const.

(10.85)
We now ask whether this resulting solution will factorize between A and B, in
other words whether q(cid:1)(A, B) = q(cid:1)(A)q(cid:1)(B). This will happen if, and only if,
ln p(A, B|X, C) = ln p(A|X, C) + ln p(B|X, C), that is, if the conditional inde-
pendence relation

A ⊥⊥ B | X, C

(10.86)

486

10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE

is satisﬁed. We can test to see if this relation does hold, for any choice of A and B
by making use of the d-separation criterion.

To illustrate this, consider again the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians represented
by the directed graph in Figure 10.5, in which we are assuming a variational fac-
torization given by (10.42). We can see immediately that the variational posterior
distribution over the parameters must factorize between π and the remaining param-
eters µ and Λ because all paths connecting π to either µ or Λ must pass through
one of the nodes zn all of which are in the conditioning set for our conditional inde-
pendence test and all of which are head-to-tail with respect to such paths.

10.3. Variational Linear Regression

Exercise 10.26

As a second illustration of variational inference, we return to the Bayesian linear
regression model of Section 3.3. In the evidence framework, we approximated the
integration over α and β by making point estimates obtained by maximizing the log
marginal likelihood. A fully Bayesian approach would integrate over the hyperpa-
rameters as well as over the parameters. Although exact integration is intractable,
we can use variational methods to ﬁnd a tractable approximation. In order to sim-
plify the discussion, we shall suppose that the noise precision parameter β is known,
and is ﬁxed to its true value, although the framework is easily extended to include
the distribution over β. For the linear regression model, the variational treatment
will turn out to be equivalent to the evidence framework. Nevertheless, it provides a
good exercise in the use of variational methods and will also lay the foundation for
variational treatment of Bayesian logistic regression in Section 10.6.

Recall that the likelihood function for w, and the prior over w, are given by

N(cid:14)

N (tn|wTφn, β

−1)

(10.87)

p(t|w) =
p(w|α) = N (w|0, α

n=1

−1I)

(10.88)
where φn = φ(xn). We now introduce a prior distribution over α. From our dis-
cussion in Section 2.3.6, we know that the conjugate prior for the precision of a
Gaussian is given by a gamma distribution, and so we choose

(10.89)
where Gam(·|·,·) is deﬁned by (B.26). Thus the joint distribution of all the variables
is given by

p(α) = Gam(α|a0, b0)

p(t, w, α) = p(t|w)p(w|α)p(α).

(10.90)

This can be represented as a directed graphical model as shown in Figure 10.8.

10.3.1 Variational distribution
Our ﬁrst goal is to ﬁnd an approximation to the posterior distribution p(w, α|t).
To do this, we employ the variational framework of Section 10.1, with a variational

posterior distribution given by the factorized expression

q(w, α) = q(w)q(α).

(10.91)

We can ﬁnd re-estimation equations for the factors in this distribution by making use
of the general result (10.9). Recall that for each factor, we take the log of the joint
distribution over all variables and then average with respect to those variables not in
that factor. Consider ﬁrst the distribution over α. Keeping only terms that have a
functional dependence on α, we have

ln q(cid:1)(α) = ln p(α) + Ew [ln p(w|α)] + const
= (a0 − 1) ln α − b0α + M
2

ln α − α

2 E[wTw] + const.

(10.92)

We recognize this as the log of a gamma distribution, and so identifying the coefﬁ-
cients of α and ln α we obtain

q(cid:1)(α) = Gam(α|aN , bN )

where

aN = a0 + M
2

2 E[wTw].

bN = b0 +

Similarly, we can ﬁnd the variational re-estimation equation for the posterior
distribution over w. Again, using the general result (10.9), and keeping only those
terms that have a functional dependence on w, we have
ln q(cid:1)(w) = ln p(t|w) + Eα [ln p(w|α)] + const

Because this is a quadratic form, the distribution q(cid:1)(w) is Gaussian, and so we can
complete the square in the usual way to identify the mean and covariance, giving

q(cid:1)(w) = N (w|mN , SN)

(10.100)
(10.101)

Note the close similarity to the posterior distribution (3.52) obtained when α was
treated as a ﬁxed parameter. The difference is that here α is replaced by its expecta-
tion E[α] under the variational distribution. Indeed, we have chosen to use the same
notation for the covariance matrix SN in both cases.

Using the standard results (B.27), (B.38), and (B.39), we can obtain the required

moments as follows

E[α] = aN /bN
E[wwT] = mN mT

N + SN .

(10.102)
(10.103)

The evaluation of the variational posterior distribution begins by initializing the pa-
rameters of one of the distributions q(w) or q(α), and then alternately re-estimates
these factors in turn until a suitable convergence criterion is satisﬁed (usually speci-
ﬁed in terms of the lower bound to be discussed shortly).

It is instructive to relate the variational solution to that found using the evidence
framework in Section 3.5. To do this consider the case a0 = b0 = 0, corresponding
to the limit of an inﬁnitely broad prior over α. The mean of the variational posterior
distribution q(α) is then given by

E[α] = aN
bN

= M/2

E[wTw]/2

=

N mN + Tr(SN) .

mT

(10.104)

Comparison with (9.63) shows that in the case of this particularly simple model,
the variational approach gives precisely the same expression as that obtained by
maximizing the evidence function using EM except that the point estimate for α
is replaced by its expected value. Because the distribution q(w) depends on q(α)
only through the expectation E[α], we see that the two approaches will give identical
results for the case of an inﬁnitely broad prior.

this model using the Gaussian variational posterior for the parameters

linear-Gaussian model. Here the input-dependent variance is given by

σ2(x) =

(10.106)

Note that this takes the same form as the result (3.59) obtained with ﬁxed α except
that now the expected value E[α] appears in the deﬁnition of SN .

10.3.3 Lower bound
Another quantity of importance is the lower bound L deﬁned by

L(q) = E[ln p(w, α, t)] − E[ln q(w, α)]
−Eα[ln q(w)]w − E[ln q(α)].

= Ew[ln p(t|w)] + Ew,α[ln p(w|α)] + Eα[ln p(α)]

Figure 10.9 shows a plot of the lower bound L(q) versus the degree of a polynomial
model for a synthetic data set generated from a degree three polynomial. Here the
prior parameters have been set to a0 = b0 = 0, corresponding to the noninformative
prior p(α) ∝ 1/α, which is uniform over ln α as discussed in Section 2.3.6. As
we saw in Section 10.1, the quantity L represents lower bound on the log marginal
likelihood p(t|M) for the model. If we assign equal prior probabilities p(M) to the
different values of M, then we can interpret L as an approximation to the poste-
rior model probability p(M|t). Thus the variational framework assigns the highest
probability to the model with M = 3. This should be contrasted with the maximum
likelihood result, which assigns ever smaller residual error to models of increasing
complexity until the residual error is driven to zero, causing maximum likelihood to
favour severely over-ﬁtted models.

10.4. Exponential Family Distributions

In Chapter 2, we discussed the important role played by the exponential family of
distributions and their conjugate priors. For many of the models discussed in this
book, the complete-data likelihood is drawn from the exponential family. However,
in general this will not be the case for the marginal likelihood function for the ob-
served data. For example, in a mixture of Gaussians, the joint distribution of obser-
vations xn and corresponding hidden variables zn is a member of the exponential
family, whereas the marginal distribution of xn is a mixture of Gaussians and hence
is not.

Up to now we have grouped the variables in the model into observed variables
and hidden variables. We now make a further distinction between latent variables,
denoted Z, and parameters, denoted θ, where parameters are intensive (ﬁxed in num-
ber independent of the size of the data set), whereas latent variables are extensive
(scale in number with the size of the data set). For example, in a Gaussian mixture
model, the indicator variables zkn (which specify which component k is responsible
for generating data point xn) represent the latent variables, whereas the means µk,
precisions Λk and mixing proportions πk represent the parameters.
Consider the case of independent identically distributed data. We denote the
data values by X = {xn}, where n = 1, . . . N, with corresponding latent variables
Z = {zn}. Now suppose that the joint distribution of observed and latent variables
is a member of the exponential family, parameterized by natural parameters η so that

p(X, Z|η) =

h(xn, zn)g(η) exp

We shall also use a conjugate prior for η, which can be written as

p(η|ν0, v0) = f(ν0, χ0)g(η)ν0 exp

νoηTχ0

Recall that the conjugate prior distribution can be interpreted as a prior number ν0
of observations all having the value χ0 for the u vector. Now consider a variational

10.4. Exponential Family Distributions

491

distribution that factorizes between the latent variables and the parameters, so that
q(Z, η) = q(Z)q(η). Using the general result (10.9), we can solve for the two
factors as follows

ln q(cid:1)(Z) = Eη[ln p(X, Z|η)] + const

=

ln h(xn, zn) + E[ηT]u(xn, zn)

+ const. (10.115)

N(cid:2)

(cid:26)

n=1

(cid:27)

(cid:27)

(cid:27)

(cid:27)

(cid:21)

Thus we see that this decomposes into a sum of independent terms, one for each
value of n, and hence the solution for q(cid:1)(Z) will factorize over n so that q(cid:1)(Z) =
n q(cid:1)(zn). This is an example of an induced factorization. Taking the exponential

Section 10.2.5

of both sides, we have

(cid:26)

(cid:26)

q(cid:1)(zn) = h(xn, zn)g (E[η]) exp

E[ηT]u(xn, zn)

(10.116)

where the normalization coefﬁcient has been re-instated by comparison with the
standard form for the exponential family.

Similarly, for the variational distribution over the parameters, we have
ln q(cid:1)(η) = ln p(η|ν0, χ0) + EZ[ln p(X, Z|η)] + const

(10.117)

= ν0 ln g(η) + ηTχ0 +

Note that the solutions for q(cid:1)(zn) and q(cid:1)(η) are coupled, and so we solve them iter-
atively in a two-stage procedure. In the variational E step, we evaluate the expected
sufﬁcient statistics E[u(xn, zn)] using the current posterior distribution q(zn) over
the latent variables and use this to compute a revised posterior distribution q(η) over
the parameters. Then in the subsequent variational M step, we use this revised pa-
rameter posterior distribution to ﬁnd the expected natural parameters E[ηT], which
gives rise to a revised variational distribution over the latent variables.

We have illustrated the application of variational methods by considering a spe-
ciﬁc model, the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, in some detail. This model can be

described by the directed graph shown in Figure 10.5. Here we consider more gen-
erally the use of variational methods for models described by directed graphs and
derive a number of widely applicable results.

The joint distribution corresponding to a directed graph can be written using the

decomposition

p(x) =

p(xi|pai)

(10.122)

where xi denotes the variable(s) associated with node i, and pai denotes the parent
set corresponding to node i. Note that xi may be a latent variable or it may belong
to the set of observed variables. Now consider a variational approximation in which
the distribution q(x) is assumed to factorize with respect to the xi so that

q(x) =

ditional distribution for xj given by p(xj|paj) together with any other conditional
distributions that have xj in the conditioning set. By deﬁnition, these conditional
distributions correspond to the children of node j, and they therefore also depend on
the co-parents of the child nodes, i.e., the other parents of the child nodes besides
node xj itself. We see that the set of all nodes on which q(cid:1)(xj) depends corresponds
to the Markov blanket of node xj, as illustrated in Figure 8.26. Thus the update
of the factors in the variational posterior distribution represents a local calculation
on the graph. This makes possible the construction of general purpose software for
variational inference in which the form of the model does not need to be speciﬁed in
advance (Bishop et al., 2003).

If we now specialize to the case of a model in which all of the conditional dis-
tributions have a conjugate-exponential structure, then the variational update proce-
dure can be cast in terms of a local message passing algorithm (Winn and Bishop,
2005). In particular, the distribution associated with a particular node can be updated
once that node has received messages from all of its parents and all of its children.
This in turn requires that the children have already received messages from their co-
parents. The evaluation of the lower bound can also be simpliﬁed because many of
the required quantities are already evaluated as part of the message passing scheme.
This distributed message passing formulation has good scaling properties and is well
suited to large networks.

10.5. Local Variational Methods

The variational framework discussed in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 can be considered a
‘global’ method in the sense that it directly seeks an approximation to the full poste-
rior distribution over all random variables. An alternative ‘local’ approach involves
ﬁnding bounds on functions over individual variables or groups of variables within
a model. For instance, we might seek a bound on a conditional distribution p(y|x),
which is itself just one factor in a much larger probabilistic model speciﬁed by a
directed graph. The purpose of introducing the bound of course is to simplify the
resulting distribution. This local approximation can be applied to multiple variables
in turn until a tractable approximation is obtained, and in Section 10.6.1 we shall
give a practical example of this approach in the context of logistic regression. Here
we focus on developing the bounds themselves.

We have already seen in our discussion of the Kullback-Leibler divergence that
the convexity of the logarithm function played a key role in developing the lower
bound in the global variational approach. We have deﬁned a (strictly) convex func-
tion as one for which every chord lies above the function. Convexity also plays a
central role in the local variational framework. Note that our discussion will ap-
ply equally to concave functions with ‘min’ and ‘max’ interchanged and with lower
bounds replaced by upper bounds.
Let us begin by considering a simple example, namely the function f(x) =
exp(−x), which is a convex function of x, and which is shown in the left-hand plot
of Figure 10.10. Our goal is to approximate f(x) by a simpler function, in particular
a linear function of x. From Figure 10.10, we see that this linear function will be a
lower bound on f(x) if it corresponds to a tangent. We can obtain the tangent line
y(x) at a speciﬁc value of x, say x = ξ, by making a ﬁrst order Taylor expansion

Section 1.6.1

(10.125)
so that y(x) (cid:1) f(x) with equality when x = ξ. For our example function f(x) =

y(x) = f(ξ) + f

(cid:4)(ξ)(x − ξ)

Figure 10.10 In the left-hand ﬁg-
ure the red curve shows the function
exp(−x), and the blue line shows
the tangent at x = ξ deﬁned by
(10.125) with ξ = 1. This line has
slope λ = f(cid:1)(ξ) = − exp(−ξ). Note
that any other tangent line, for ex-
ample the ones shown in green, will
have a smaller value of y at x =
ξ. The right-hand ﬁgure shows the
corresponding plot of
the function
λξ − g(λ), where g(λ) is given by
(10.131), versus λ for ξ = 1,
in
which the maximum corresponds to
λ = − exp(−ξ) = −1/e.

Figure 10.11 In the left-hand plot the red curve shows a convex function f (x), and the blue line represents the
linear function λx, which is a lower bound on f (x) because f (x) > λx for all x. For the given value of slope λ the
contact point of the tangent line having the same slope is found by minimizing with respect to x the discrepancy
(shown by the green dashed lines) given by f (x) − λx. This deﬁnes the dual function g(λ), which corresponds
to the (negative of the) intercept of the tangent line having slope λ.

exp(−x), we therefore obtain the tangent line in the form

y(x) = exp(−ξ) − exp(−ξ)(x − ξ)

(10.126)

which is a linear function parameterized by ξ. For consistency with subsequent
discussion, let us deﬁne λ = − exp(−ξ) so that

y(x, λ) = λx − λ + λ ln(−λ).

Different values of λ correspond to different tangent lines, and because all such lines
are lower bounds on the function, we have f(x) (cid:2) y(x, λ). Thus we can write the
function in the form

(10.127)

(10.128)

f(x) = max

λ

{λx − λ + λ ln(−λ)} .

We have succeeded in approximating the convex function f(x) by a simpler, lin-
ear function y(x, λ). The price we have paid is that we have introduced a variational
parameter λ, and to obtain the tightest bound we must optimize with respect to λ.

We can formulate this approach more generally using the framework of convex
duality (Rockafellar, 1972; Jordan et al., 1999). Consider the illustration of a convex
function f(x) shown in the left-hand plot in Figure 10.11.
In this example, the
function λx is a lower bound on f(x) but it is not the best lower bound that can
be achieved by a linear function having slope λ, because the tightest bound is given
by the tangent line. Let us write the equation of the tangent line, having slope λ as
λx − g(λ) where the (negative) intercept g(λ) clearly depends on the slope λ of the
tangent. To determine the intercept, we note that the line must be moved vertically by
an amount equal to the smallest vertical distance between the line and the function,
as shown in Figure 10.11. Thus

g(λ) = − min

(10.129)

10.5. Local Variational Methods

Now, instead of ﬁxing λ and varying x, we can consider a particular x and then
adjust λ until the tangent plane is tangent at that particular x. Because the y value
of the tangent line at a particular x is maximized when that value coincides with its
contact point, we have

{λx − g(λ)} .

(10.130)

f(x) = max

λ

We see that the functions f(x) and g(λ) play a dual role, and are related through
(10.129) and (10.130).
Let us apply these duality relations to our simple example f(x) = exp(−x).
From (10.129) we see that the maximizing value of x is given by ξ = − ln(−λ), and
back-substituting we obtain the conjugate function g(λ) in the form

g(λ) = λ − λ ln(−λ)

(10.131)
as obtained previously. The function λξ − g(λ) is shown, for ξ = 1 in the right-hand
plot in Figure 10.10. As a check, we can substitute (10.131) into (10.130), which
gives the maximizing value of λ = − exp(−x), and back-substituting then recovers
the original function f(x) = exp(−x).

For concave functions, we can follow a similar argument to obtain upper bounds,

in which max’ is replaced with ‘min’, so that

f(x) = min
λ
g(λ) = min

{λx − g(λ)}
{λx − f(x)} .

(10.132)

(10.133)

If the function of interest is not convex (or concave), then we cannot directly
apply the method above to obtain a bound. However, we can ﬁrst seek invertible
transformations either of the function or of its argument which change it into a con-
vex form. We then calculate the conjugate function and then transform back to the
original variables.

An important example, which arises frequently in pattern recognition, is the

logistic sigmoid function deﬁned by

σ(x) =

1

1 + e−x .

(10.134)

As it stands this function is neither convex nor concave. However, if we take the
logarithm we obtain a function which is concave, as is easily veriﬁed by ﬁnding the
second derivative. From (10.133) the corresponding conjugate function then takes
the form

g(λ) = min
x

{λx − f(x)} = −λ ln λ − (1 − λ) ln(1 − λ)

(10.135)

which we recognize as the binary entropy function for a variable whose probability
of having the value 1 is λ. Using (10.132), we then obtain an upper bound on the log
sigmoid

Exercise 10.31

which is plotted for two values of λ on the left-hand plot in Figure 10.12.

We can also obtain a lower bound on the sigmoid having the functional form of
a Gaussian. To do this, we follow Jaakkola and Jordan (2000) and make transforma-
tions both of the input variable and of the function itself. First we take the log of the
logistic function and then decompose it so that

the variable x2, as can again be veriﬁed by ﬁnding the second derivative. This leads
to a lower bound on f(x), which is a linear function of x2 whose conjugate function

Instead of thinking of λ as the variational parameter, we can let ξ play this role as
this leads to simpler expressions for the conjugate function, which is then given by

g(λ) = λ(ξ)ξ2 − f(ξ) = λ(ξ)ξ2 + ln(eξ/2 + e

−ξ/2).

Hence the bound on f(x) can be written as

f(x) (cid:2) λx2 − g(λ) = λx2 − λξ2 − ln(eξ/2 + e

Section 4.3

where λ(ξ) is deﬁned by (10.141). This bound is illustrated in the right-hand plot of
Figure 10.12. We see that the bound has the form of the exponential of a quadratic
function of x, which will prove useful when we seek Gaussian representations of
posterior distributions deﬁned through logistic sigmoid functions.

The logistic sigmoid arises frequently in probabilistic models over binary vari-
ables because it is the function that transforms a log odds ratio into a posterior prob-
ability. The corresponding transformation for a multiclass distribution is given by
the softmax function. Unfortunately, the lower bound derived here for the logistic
sigmoid does not directly extend to the softmax. Gibbs (1997) proposes a method
for constructing a Gaussian distribution that is conjectured to be a bound (although
no rigorous proof is given), which may be used to apply local variational methods to
multiclass problems.

We shall see an example of the use of local variational bounds in Sections 10.6.1.
For the moment, however, it is instructive to consider in general terms how these
bounds can be used. Suppose we wish to evaluate an integral of the form

(cid:6)

I =

σ(a)p(a) da

(10.145)

where σ(a) is the logistic sigmoid, and p(a) is a Gaussian probability density. Such
integrals arise in Bayesian models when, for instance, we wish to evaluate the pre-
dictive distribution, in which case p(a) represents a posterior parameter distribution.
Because the integral is intractable, we employ the variational bound (10.144), which
we write in the form σ(a) (cid:2) f(a, ξ) where ξ is a variational parameter. The inte-
gral now becomes the product of two exponential-quadratic functions and so can be
integrated analytically to give a bound on I

f(a, ξ)p(a) da = F (ξ).

(10.146)

(cid:6)

I (cid:2)

We now have the freedom to choose the variational parameter ξ, which we do by
ﬁnding the value ξ(cid:1) that maximizes the function F (ξ). The resulting value F (ξ(cid:1))
represents the tightest bound within this family of bounds and can be used as an
approximation to I. This optimized bound, however, will in general not be exact.

498

10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE

Although the bound σ(a) (cid:2) f(a, ξ) on the logistic sigmoid can be optimized exactly,
the required choice for ξ depends on the value of a, so that the bound is exact for one
value of a only. Because the quantity F (ξ) is obtained by integrating over all values
of a, the value of ξ(cid:1) represents a compromise, weighted by the distribution p(a).

10.6. Variational Logistic Regression

We now illustrate the use of local variational methods by returning to the Bayesian
logistic regression model studied in Section 4.5. There we focussed on the use of
the Laplace approximation, while here we consider a variational treatment based on
the approach of Jaakkola and Jordan (2000). Like the Laplace method, this also
leads to a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution. However, the greater
ﬂexibility of the variational approximation leads to improved accuracy compared
to the Laplace method. Furthermore (unlike the Laplace method), the variational
approach is optimizing a well deﬁned objective function given by a rigourous bound
on the model evidence. Logistic regression has also been treated by Dybowski and
Roberts (2005) from a Bayesian perspective using Monte Carlo sampling techniques.

10.6.1 Variational posterior distribution
Here we shall make use of a variational approximation based on the local bounds
introduced in Section 10.5. This allows the likelihood function for logistic regres-
sion, which is governed by the logistic sigmoid, to be approximated by the expo-
nential of a quadratic form. It is therefore again convenient to choose a conjugate
Gaussian prior of the form (4.140). For the moment, we shall treat the hyperparam-
eters m0 and S0 as ﬁxed constants. In Section 10.6.3, we shall demonstrate how the
variational formalism can be extended to the case where there are unknown hyper-
parameters whose values are to be inferred from the data.

In the variational framework, we seek to maximize a lower bound on the marginal
likelihood. For the Bayesian logistic regression model, the marginal likelihood takes
the form

(cid:6) (cid:31)

N(cid:14)

p(tn|w)

Note that because this bound is applied to each of the terms in the likelihood function
separately, there is a variational parameter ξn corresponding to each training set
observation (φn, tn). Using a = wTφ, and multiplying by the prior distribution, we
obtain the following bound on the joint distribution of t and w
p(t, w) = p(t|w)p(w) (cid:2) h(w, ξ)p(w)
where ξ denotes the set {ξn} of variational parameters, and

Evaluation of the exact posterior distribution would require normalization of the left-
hand side of this inequality. Because this is intractable, we work instead with the
right-hand side. Note that the function on the right-hand side cannot be interpreted
as a probability density because it is not normalized. Once it is normalized to give a
variational posterior distribution q(w), however, it no longer represents a bound.
Because the logarithm function is monotonically increasing, the inequality A (cid:2)
B implies ln A (cid:2) ln B. This gives a lower bound on the log of the joint distribution
of t and w of the form

ln{p(t|w)p(w)} (cid:2) ln p(w) +

As with the Laplace framework, we have again obtained a Gaussian approximation
to the posterior distribution. However, the additional ﬂexibility provided by the vari-
ational parameters {ξn} leads to improved accuracy in the approximation (Jaakkola
and Jordan, 2000).

Here we have considered a batch learning context in which all of the training
data is available at once. However, Bayesian methods are intrinsically well suited
to sequential learning in which the data points are processed one at a time and then
discarded. The formulation of this variational approach for the sequential case is
straightforward.

Note that the bound given by (10.149) applies only to the two-class problem and
so this approach does not directly generalize to classiﬁcation problems with K > 2
classes. An alternative bound for the multiclass case has been explored by Gibbs
(1997).

Exercise 10.32

10.6.2 Optimizing the variational parameters
We now have a normalized Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution,
which we shall use shortly to evaluate the predictive distribution for new data points.
First, however, we need to determine the variational parameters {ξn} by maximizing
the lower bound on the marginal likelihood.

To do this, we substitute the inequality (10.152) back into the marginal likeli-

(cid:6)

ln p(t) = ln

p(t|w)p(w) dw (cid:2) ln

h(w, ξ)p(w) dw = L(ξ).

(10.159)

As with the optimization of the hyperparameter α in the linear regression model of
Section 3.5, there are two approaches to determining the ξn. In the ﬁrst approach, we
recognize that the function L(ξ) is deﬁned by an integration over w and so we can
view w as a latent variable and invoke the EM algorithm. In the second approach,
we integrate over w analytically and then perform a direct maximization over ξ. Let
us begin by considering the EM approach.
{ξn}, which we denote collectively by ξold.

The EM algorithm starts by choosing some initial values for the parameters
In the E step of the EM algorithm,

we then use these parameter values to ﬁnd the posterior distribution over w, which
is given by (10.156). In the M step, we then maximize the expected complete-data
log likelihood which is given by

Q(ξ, ξold) = E [ln h(w, ξ)p(w)]

(10.160)

where the expectation is taken with respect to the posterior distribution q(w) evalu-
ated using ξold. Noting that p(w) does not depend on ξ, and substituting for h(w, ξ)
we obtain

Let us summarize the EM algorithm for ﬁnding the variational posterior distri-

the posterior distribution over w given by (10.156), in which the mean and covari-
ance are deﬁned by (10.157) and (10.158). In the M step, we then use this variational
posterior to compute a new value for ξ given by (10.163). The E and M steps are
repeated until a suitable convergence criterion is satisﬁed, which in practice typically
requires only a few iterations.
An alternative approach to obtaining re-estimation equations for ξ is to note
that in the integral over w in the deﬁnition (10.159) of the lower bound L(ξ), the
integrand has a Gaussian-like form and so the integral can be evaluated analytically.
Having evaluated the integral, we can then differentiate with respect to ξn. It turns
out that this gives rise to exactly the same re-estimation equations as does the EM
approach given by (10.163).
As we have emphasized already, in the application of variational methods it is
useful to be able to evaluate the lower bound L(ξ) given by (10.159). The integration
over w can be performed analytically by noting that p(w) is Gaussian and h(w, ξ)
is the exponential of a quadratic function of w. Thus, by completing the square
and making use of the standard result for the normalization coefﬁcient of a Gaussian
distribution, we can obtain a closed form solution which takes the form

Figure 10.13 Illustration of the Bayesian approach to logistic regression for a simple linearly separable data
set. The plot on the left shows the predictive distribution obtained using variational inference. We see that
the decision boundary lies roughly mid way between the clusters of data points, and that the contours of the
predictive distribution splay out away from the data reﬂecting the greater uncertainty in the classiﬁcation of such
regions. The plot on the right shows the decision boundaries corresponding to ﬁve samples of the parameter
vector w drawn from the posterior distribution p(w|t).

This variational framework can also be applied to situations in which the data
is arriving sequentially (Jaakkola and Jordan, 2000).
In this case we maintain a
Gaussian posterior distribution over w, which is initialized using the prior p(w). As
each data point arrives, the posterior is updated by making use of the bound (10.151)
and then normalized to give an updated posterior distribution.

The predictive distribution is obtained by marginalizing over the posterior dis-
tribution, and takes the same form as for the Laplace approximation discussed in
Section 4.5.2. Figure 10.13 shows the variational predictive distributions for a syn-
thetic data set. This example provides interesting insights into the concept of ‘large
margin’, which was discussed in Section 7.1 and which has qualitatively similar be-
haviour to the Bayesian solution.

10.6.3 Inference of hyperparameters
So far, we have treated the hyperparameter α in the prior distribution as a known
constant. We now extend the Bayesian logistic regression model to allow the value of
this parameter to be inferred from the data set. This can be achieved by combining
the global and local variational approximations into a single framework, so as to
maintain a lower bound on the marginal likelihood at each stage. Such a combined
approach was adopted by Bishop and Svens´en (2003) in the context of a Bayesian
treatment of the hierarchical mixture of experts model.

10.6. Variational Logistic Regression

503

Speciﬁcally, we consider once again a simple isotropic Gaussian prior distribu-

tion of the form

p(w|α) = N (w|0, α

−1I).

(10.165)
Our analysis is readily extended to more general Gaussian priors, for instance if we
wish to associate a different hyperparameter with different subsets of the parame-
ters wj. As usual, we consider a conjugate hyperprior over α given by a gamma
distribution

p(α) = Gam(α|a0, b0)

(10.166)

governed by the constants a0 and b0.

The marginal likelihood for this model now takes the form

(cid:6)(cid:6)

p(t) =

p(w, α, t) dw dα

(10.167)

where the joint distribution is given by

p(w, α, t) = p(t|w)p(w|α)p(α).

(10.168)

We are now faced with an analytically intractable integration over w and α, which
we shall tackle by using both the local and global variational approaches in the same
model

To begin with, we introduce a variational distribution q(w, α), and then apply

the decomposition (10.2), which in this instance takes the form

(10.169)
where the lower bound L(q) and the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(q(cid:5)p) are de-
ﬁned by

ln p(t) = L(q) + KL(q(cid:5)p)

(cid:12)

(cid:13)

dw dα

KL(q(cid:5)p) = −

q(w, α) ln

(10.171)
At this point, the lower bound L(q) is still intractable due to the form of the
likelihood factor p(t|w). We therefore apply the local variational bound to each of
the logistic sigmoid factors as before. This allows us to use the inequality (10.152)
and place a lower bound on L(q), which will therefore also be a lower bound on the
log marginal likelihood

dw dα.

L(q) =

(10.172)

Next we assume that the variational distribution factorizes between parameters and
hyperparameters so that

q(w, α) = q(w)q(α).

(10.173)

504

10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE

With this factorization we can appeal to the general result (10.9) to ﬁnd expressions
for the optimal factors. Consider ﬁrst the distribution q(w). Discarding terms that
are independent of w, we have

ln q(w) = Eα [ln{h(w, ξ)p(w|α)p(α)}] + const
= ln h(w, ξ) + Eα [ln p(w|α)] + const.

We now substitute for ln h(w, ξ) using (10.153), and for ln p(w|α) using (10.165),
giving

10.7. Expectation Propagation

We conclude this chapter by discussing an alternative form of deterministic approx-
imate inference, known as expectation propagation or EP (Minka, 2001a; Minka,
2001b). As with the variational Bayes methods discussed so far, this too is based
on the minimization of a Kullback-Leibler divergence but now of the reverse form,
which gives the approximation rather different properties.
Consider for a moment the problem of minimizing KL(p(cid:5)q) with respect to q(z)
when p(z) is a ﬁxed distribution and q(z) is a member of the exponential family and
so, from (2.194), can be written in the form

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

q(z) = h(z)g(η) exp

ηTu(z)

.

(10.184)

As a function of η, the Kullback-Leibler divergence then becomes

KL(p(cid:5)q) = − ln g(η) − ηT

Ep(z)[u(z)] + const

(10.185)

where the constant terms are independent of the natural parameters η. We can mini-
mize KL(p(cid:5)q) within this family of distributions by setting the gradient with respect
to η to zero, giving

(10.186)
However, we have already seen in (2.226) that the negative gradient of ln g(η) is
given by the expectation of u(z) under the distribution q(z). Equating these two
results, we obtain

−∇ ln g(η) = Ep(z)[u(z)].

Eq(z)[u(z)] = Ep(z)[u(z)].

(10.187)

506

10. APPROXIMATE INFERENCE

We see that the optimum solution simply corresponds to matching the expected suf-
ﬁcient statistics. So, for instance, if q(z) is a Gaussian N (z|µ, Σ) then we minimize
the Kullback-Leibler divergence by setting the mean µ of q(z) equal to the mean of
the distribution p(z) and the covariance Σ equal to the covariance of p(z). This is
sometimes called moment matching. An example of this was seen in Figure 10.3(a).
Now let us exploit this result to obtain a practical algorithm for approximate
inference. For many probabilistic models, the joint distribution of data D and hidden
variables (including parameters) θ comprises a product of factors in the form

p(D, θ) =

fi(θ).

(10.188)

(cid:14)

i

This would arise, for example, in a model for independent, identically distributed
data in which there is one factor fn(θ) = p(xn|θ) for each data point xn, along
with a factor f0(θ) = p(θ) corresponding to the prior. More generally, it would also
apply to any model deﬁned by a directed probabilistic graph in which each factor is a
conditional distribution corresponding to one of the nodes, or an undirected graph in
which each factor is a clique potential. We are interested in evaluating the posterior
distribution p(θ|D) for the purpose of making predictions, as well as the model
evidence p(D) for the purpose of model comparison. From (10.188) the posterior is
given by

p(θ|D) =

fi(θ)

(10.189)

(cid:14)

p(D)

and the model evidence is given by
p(D) =

fi(θ) dθ.

(10.190)

Here we are considering continuous variables, but the following discussion applies
equally to discrete variables with integrals replaced by summations. We shall sup-
pose that the marginalization over θ, along with the marginalizations with respect to
the posterior distribution required to make predictions, are intractable so that some
form of approximation is required.

Expectation propagation is based on an approximation to the posterior distribu-

tion which is also given by a product of factors

q(θ) =

in which each factor(cid:4)fi(θ) in the approximation corresponds to one of the factors
obtain a practical algorithm, we need to constrain the factors(cid:4)fi(θ) in some way,

fi(θ) in the true posterior (10.189), and the factor 1/Z is the normalizing constant
needed to ensure that the left-hand side of (10.191) integrates to unity. In order to

Note that this is the reverse form of KL divergence compared with that used in varia-
tional inference. In general, this minimization will be intractable because the KL di-
vergence involves averaging with respect to the true distribution. As a rough approx-
imation, we could instead minimize the KL divergences between the corresponding

pairs fi(θ) and(cid:4)fi(θ) of factors. This represents a much simpler problem to solve,

and has the advantage that the algorithm is noniterative. However, because each fac-
tor is individually approximated, the product of the factors could well give a poor
approximation.

This is similar in spirit to the update of factors in the variational Bayes framework

Expectation propagation makes a much better approximation by optimizing each
factor in turn in the context of all of the remaining factors. It starts by initializing

the factors(cid:4)fi(θ), and then cycles through the factors reﬁning them one at a time.

This is easily solved because the approximating distribution qnew(θ) is from the ex-
ponential family, and so we can appeal to the result (10.187), which tells us that the
parameters of qnew(θ) are obtained by matching its expected sufﬁcient statistics to
the corresponding moments of (10.196). We shall assume that this is a tractable oper-
ation. For example, if we choose q(θ) to be a Gaussian distribution N (θ|µ, Σ), then

µ is set equal to the mean of the (unnormalized) distribution fj(θ)q
set to its covariance. More generally, it is straightforward to obtain the required ex-
pectations for any member of the exponential family, provided it can be normalized,
because the expected statistics can be related to the derivatives of the normalization
coefﬁcient, as given by (2.226). The EP approximation is illustrated in Figure 10.14.

From (10.193), we see that the revised factor (cid:4)fj(θ) can be found by taking

qnew(θ) and dividing out the remaining factors so that

(cid:4)fj(θ) = K

qnew(θ)

(10.201)

Combining this with (10.197), we then see that K = Zj and so can be found by
evaluating the integral in (10.197).
In practice, several passes are made through the set of factors, revising each
factor in turn. The posterior distribution p(θ|D) is then approximated using (10.191),
and the model evidence p(D) can be approximated by using (10.190) with the factors

fi(θ) replaced by their approximations(cid:4)fi(θ).

A special case of EP, known as assumed density ﬁltering (ADF) or moment
matching (Maybeck, 1982; Lauritzen, 1992; Boyen and Koller, 1998; Opper and
Winther, 1999), is obtained by initializing all of the approximating factors except
the ﬁrst to unity and then making one pass through the factors updating each of them
once. Assumed density ﬁltering can be appropriate for on-line learning in which data
points are arriving in a sequence and we need to learn from each data point and then
discard it before considering the next point. However, in a batch setting we have the
opportunity to re-use the data points many times in order to achieve improved ac-
curacy, and it is this idea that is exploited in expectation propagation. Furthermore,
if we apply ADF to batch data, the results will have an undesirable dependence on
the (arbitrary) order in which the data points are considered, which again EP can
overcome.

One disadvantage of expectation propagation is that there is no guarantee that
the iterations will converge. However, for approximations q(θ) in the exponential
family, if the iterations do converge, the resulting solution will be a stationary point
of a particular energy function (Minka, 2001a), although each iteration of EP does
not necessarily decrease the value of this energy function. This is in contrast to
variational Bayes, which iteratively maximizes a lower bound on the log marginal
likelihood, in which each iteration is guaranteed not to decrease the bound. It is
possible to optimize the EP cost function directly, in which case it is guaranteed
to converge, although the resulting algorithms can be slower and more complex to
implement.

Another difference between variational Bayes and EP arises from the form of
KL divergence that is minimized by the two algorithms, because the former mini-
mizes KL(q(cid:5)p) whereas the latter minimizes KL(p(cid:5)q). As we saw in Figure 10.3,
for distributions p(θ) which are multimodal, minimizing KL(p(cid:5)q) can lead to poor
approximations. In particular, if EP is applied to mixtures the results are not sen-
sible because the approximation tries to capture all of the modes of the posterior
distribution. Conversely, in logistic-type models, EP often out-performs both local
variational methods and the Laplace approximation (Kuss and Rasmussen, 2006).

10.7.1 Example: The clutter problem
Following Minka (2001b), we illustrate the EP algorithm using a simple exam-
ple in which the goal is to infer the mean θ of a multivariate Gaussian distribution
over a variable x given a set of observations drawn from that distribution. To make
the problem more interesting, the observations are embedded in background clutter,
which itself is also Gaussian distributed, as illustrated in Figure 10.15. The distribu-
tion of observed values x is therefore a mixture of Gaussians, which we take to be
of the form

p(x|θ) = (1 − w)N (x|θ, I) + wN (x|0, aI)

(10.209)

where w is the proportion of background clutter and is assumed to be known. The
prior over θ is taken to be Gaussian

p(θ) = N (θ|0, bI)

(10.210)

and Minka (2001a) chooses the parameter values a = 10, b = 100 and w = 0.5.
The joint distribution of N observations D = {x1, . . . , xN} and θ is given by

N(cid:14)

p(D, θ) = p(θ)

p(xn|θ)

(10.211)

n=1

and so the posterior distribution comprises a mixture of 2N Gaussians. Thus the
computational cost of solving this problem exactly would grow exponentially with
the size of the data set, and so an exact solution is intractable for moderately large
N.
To apply EP to the clutter problem, we ﬁrst identify the factors f0(θ) = p(θ)
and fn(θ) = p(xn|θ). Next we select an approximating distribution from the expo-
nential family, and for this example it is convenient to choose a spherical Gaussian

q(θ) = N (θ|m, vI).

The factor approximations will therefore take the form of exponential-quadratic
functions of the form

where n = 1, . . . , N, and we set(cid:4)f0(θ) equal to the prior p(θ). Note that the use of
convenient shorthand notation. The approximations(cid:4)fn(θ), for n = 1, . . . , N, can

(in fact, as we shall see, the variance parameter vn can be negative) but is simply a
be initialized to unity, corresponding to sn = (2πvn)D/2, vn → ∞ and mn = 0,
where D is the dimensionality of x and hence of θ. The initial q(θ), deﬁned by
(10.191), is therefore equal to the prior.

We then iteratively reﬁne the factors by taking one factor fn(θ) at a time and
applying (10.205), (10.206), and (10.207). Note that we do not need to revise the
term f0(θ) because an EP update will leave this term unchanged. Here we state the
results and leave the reader to ﬁll in the details.

Examples factor approximations for the clutter problem with a one-dimensional pa-
rameter space θ are shown in Figure 10.16. Note that the factor approximations can
have inﬁnite or even negative values for the ‘variance’ parameter vn. This simply
corresponds to approximations that curve upwards instead of downwards and are not
necessarily problematic provided the overall approximate posterior q(θ) has posi-
tive variance. Figure 10.17 compares the performance of EP with variational Bayes
(mean ﬁeld theory) and the Laplace approximation on the clutter problem.

10.7.2 Expectation propagation on graphs
So far in our general discussion of EP, we have allowed the factors fi(θ) in the
distribution p(θ) to be functions of all of the components of θ, and similarly for the

approximating factors(cid:4)f(θ) in the approximating distribution q(θ). We now consider

situations in which the factors depend only on subsets of the variables. Such restric-
tions can be conveniently expressed using the framework of probabilistic graphical
models, as discussed in Chapter 8. Here we use a factor graph representation because
this encompasses both directed and undirected graphs.

Figure 10.17 Comparison of expectation propagation, variational inference, and the Laplace approximation on
the clutter problem. The left-hand plot shows the error in the predicted posterior mean versus the number of
ﬂoating point operations, and the right-hand plot shows the corresponding results for the model evidence.

We shall focus on the case in which the approximating distribution is fully fac-
torized, and we shall show that in this case expectation propagation reduces to loopy
belief propagation (Minka, 2001a). To start with, we show this in the context of a
simple example, and then we shall explore the general case.
First of all, recall from (10.17) that if we minimize the Kullback-Leibler diver-
gence KL(p(cid:5)q) with respect to a factorized distribution q, then the optimal solution
for each factor is simply the corresponding marginal of p.

Section 8.4.4

Now consider the factor graph shown on the left in Figure 10.18, which was
introduced earlier in the context of the sum-product algorithm. The joint distribution
is given by

We seek an approximation q(x) that has the same factorization, so that

p(x) = fa(x1, x2)fb(x2, x3)fc(x2, x4).

q(x) ∝(cid:4)fa(x1, x2)(cid:4)fb(x2, x3)(cid:4)fc(x2, x4).

(10.225)

(10.226)

Note that normalization constants have been omitted, and these can be re-instated at
the end by local normalization, as is generally done in belief propagation. Now sup-
pose we restrict attention to approximations in which the factors themselves factorize
with respect to the individual variables so that

q(x) ∝(cid:4)fa1(x1)(cid:4)fa2(x2)(cid:4)fb2(x2)(cid:4)fb3(x3)(cid:4)fc2(x2)(cid:4)fc4(x4)

(10.227)

which corresponds to the factor graph shown on the right in Figure 10.18. Because
the individual factors are factorized, the overall distribution q(x) is itself fully fac-
torized.

Now we apply the EP algorithm using the fully factorized approximation. Sup-
pose that we have initialized all of the factors and that we choose to reﬁne factor

The result, as noted above, is that qnew(z) comprises the product of factors, one for
each variable xi, in which each factor is given by the corresponding marginal of

\b(x)fb(x2, x3) =(cid:4)fa1(x1)(cid:4)fa2(x2)(cid:4)fc2(x2)(cid:4)fc4(x4)fb(x2, x3).

(cid:1)p(x) = q
We now ﬁnd qnew(x) by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL((cid:1)p(cid:5)qnew).
(cid:1)p(x). These four marginals are given by
(cid:1)p(x1) ∝ (cid:4)fa1(x1)

(cid:2)

and qnew(x) is obtained by multiplying these marginals together. We see that the

only factors in q(x) that change when we update(cid:4)fb(x2, x3) are those that involve
the variables in fb namely x2 and x3. To obtain the reﬁned factor(cid:4)fb(x2, x3) =

by deﬁnition, while the reﬁned version of(cid:4)fb3(x3) is again given by (10.235). If

This result differs slightly from standard belief propagation in that messages are
passed in both directions at the same time. We can easily modify the EP procedure
to give the standard form of the sum-product algorithm by updating just one of the

we are reﬁning only one term at a time, then we can choose the order in which the
reﬁnements are done as we wish. In particular, for a tree-structured graph we can
follow a two-pass update scheme, corresponding to the standard belief propagation
schedule, which will result in exact inference of the variable and factor marginals.
The initialization of the approximation factors in this case is unimportant.

Now let us consider a general factor graph corresponding to the distribution

(cid:14)

p(θ) =

fi(θi)

(10.236)

where θi represents the subset of variables associated with factor fi. We approximate
this using a fully factorized distribution of the form

the particular term(cid:4)fjl(θl) keeping all other terms ﬁxed. We ﬁrst remove the term
(cid:4)fj(θj) from q(θ) to give

We recognize this as the sum-product rule in the form in which messages from vari-
able nodes to factor nodes have been eliminated, as illustrated by the example shown

in Figure 8.50. The quantity(cid:4)fjm(θm) corresponds to the message µfj→θm(θm),

which factor node j sends to variable node m, and the product over k in (10.240)
is over all factors that depend on the variables θm that have variables (other than
variable θl) in common with factor fj(θj). In other words, to compute the outgoing
message from a factor node, we take the product of all the incoming messages from
other factor nodes, multiply by the local factor, and then marginalize.

Thus, the sum-product algorithm arises as a special case of expectation propa-
gation if we use an approximating distribution that is fully factorized. This suggests
that more ﬂexible approximating distributions, corresponding to partially discon-
nected graphs, could be used to achieve higher accuracy. Another generalization is
to group factors fi(θi) together into sets and to reﬁne all the factors in a set together
at each iteration. Both of these approaches can lead to improvements in accuracy
(Minka, 2001b). In general, the problem of choosing the best combination of group-
ing and disconnection is an open research issue.

We have seen that variational message passing and expectation propagation op-
timize two different forms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Minka (2005) has
shown that a broad range of message passing algorithms can be derived from a com-
mon framework involving minimization of members of the alpha family of diver-
gences, given by (10.19). These include variational message passing, loopy belief
propagation, and expectation propagation, as well as a range of other algorithms,
which we do not have space to discuss here, such as tree-reweighted message pass-
ing (Wainwright et al., 2005), fractional belief propagation (Wiegerinck and Heskes,
2003), and power EP (Minka, 2004).

10.18 ((cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12))

In this exercise, we shall derive the variational re-estimation equations for
the Gaussian mixture model by direct differentiation of the lower bound. To do this
we assume that the variational distribution has the factorization deﬁned by (10.42)
and (10.55) with factors given by (10.48), (10.57), and (10.59). Substitute these into
(10.70) and hence obtain the lower bound as a function of the parameters of the varia-
tional distribution. Then, by maximizing the bound with respect to these parameters,
derive the re-estimation equations for the factors in the variational distribution, and
show that these are the same as those obtained in Section 10.2.1.

10.19 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) Derive the result (10.81) for the predictive distribution in the variational treat-

ment of the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians model.

10.20 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) www This exercise explores the variational Bayes solution for the mixture of
Gaussians model when the size N of the data set is large and shows that it reduces (as
we would expect) to the maximum likelihood solution based on EM derived in Chap-
ter 9. Note that results from Appendix B may be used to help answer this exercise.
First show that the posterior distribution q(cid:1)(Λk) of the precisions becomes sharply
peaked around the maximum likelihood solution. Do the same for the posterior dis-
tribution of the means q(cid:1)(µk|Λk). Next consider the posterior distribution q(cid:1)(π)
for the mixing coefﬁcients and show that this too becomes sharply peaked around
the maximum likelihood solution. Similarly, show that the responsibilities become
equal to the corresponding maximum likelihood values for large N, by making use
of the following asymptotic result for the digamma function for large x

ψ(x) = ln x + O (1/x) .

(10.241)

Finally, by making use of (10.80), show that for large N, the predictive distribution
becomes a mixture of Gaussians.

10.22 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) We have seen that each mode of the posterior distribution in a Gaussian mix-
ture model is a member of a family of K! equivalent modes. Suppose that the result
of running the variational inference algorithm is an approximate posterior distribu-
tion q that is localized in the neighbourhood of one of the modes. We can then
approximate the full posterior distribution as a mixture of K! such q distributions,
once centred on each mode and having equal mixing coefﬁcients. Show that if we
assume negligible overlap between the components of the q mixture, the resulting
lower bound differs from that for a single component q distribution through the ad-
dition of an extra term ln K!.

10.23 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) www Consider a variational Gaussian mixture model in which there is no
prior distribution over mixing coefﬁcients {πk}. Instead, the mixing coefﬁcients are
treated as parameters, whose values are to be found by maximizing the variational
lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. Show that maximizing this lower bound
with respect to the mixing coefﬁcients, using a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the
constraint that the mixing coefﬁcients sum to one, leads to the re-estimation result
(10.83). Note that there is no need to consider all of the terms in the lower bound but
only the dependence of the bound on the {πk}.

10.24 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) www We have seen in Section 10.2 that the singularities arising in the max-
imum likelihood treatment of Gaussian mixture models do not arise in a Bayesian
treatment. Discuss whether such singularities would arise if the Bayesian model
were solved using maximum posterior (MAP) estimation.

10.25 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) The variational treatment of the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, discussed in
Section 10.2, made use of a factorized approximation (10.5) to the posterior distribu-
tion. As we saw in Figure 10.2, the factorized assumption causes the variance of the
posterior distribution to be under-estimated for certain directions in parameter space.
Discuss qualitatively the effect this will have on the variational approximation to the
model evidence, and how this effect will vary with the number of components in
the mixture. Hence explain whether the variational Gaussian mixture will tend to
under-estimate or over-estimate the optimal number of components.

update equations for the three factors in the variational distribution and also obtain
an expression for the lower bound and for the predictive distribution.

10.27 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) By making use of the formulae given in Appendix B show that the variational
lower bound for the linear basis function regression model, deﬁned by (10.107), can
be written in the form (10.107) with the various terms deﬁned by (10.108)–(10.112).

10.28 ((cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)) Rewrite the model for the Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, introduced in
Section 10.2, as a conjugate model from the exponential family, as discussed in
Section 10.4. Hence use the general results (10.115) and (10.119) to derive the

proximation to the posterior distribution can be maintained through the use of the
lower bound (10.151), in which the distribution is initialized using the prior, and as
each data point is absorbed its corresponding variational parameter ξn is optimized.

In this exercise we derive re-estimation equations for the variational parame-

of the lower bound given by (10.164). To do this set the derivative of L(ξ) with re-
spect to ξn equal to zero, making use of the result (3.117) for the derivative of the log
of a determinant, together with the expressions (10.157) and (10.158) which deﬁne
the mean and covariance of the variational posterior distribution q(w).

10.35 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) Derive the result (10.164) for the lower bound L(ξ) in the variational logistic
regression model. This is most easily done by substituting the expressions for the
Gaussian prior q(w) = N (w|m0, S0), together with the lower bound h(w, ξ) on
the likelihood function, into the integral (10.159) which deﬁnes L(ξ). Next gather
together the terms which depend on w in the exponential and complete the square
to give a Gaussian integral, which can then be evaluated by invoking the standard
result for the normalization coefﬁcient of a multivariate Gaussian. Finally take the
logarithm to obtain (10.164).

the factor(cid:4)f0(θ) is initialized to be f0(θ), then an EP update to reﬁne(cid:4)f0(θ) leaves
(cid:4)f0(θ) unchanged. This situation typically arises when one of the factors is the prior

Sampling
Methods

For most probabilistic models of practical interest, exact inference is intractable, and
so we have to resort to some form of approximation. In Chapter 10, we discussed
inference algorithms based on deterministic approximations, which include methods
such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation. Here we consider approxi-
mate inference methods based on numerical sampling, also known as Monte Carlo
techniques.

Although for some applications the posterior distribution over unobserved vari-
ables will be of direct interest in itself, for most situations the posterior distribution
is required primarily for the purpose of evaluating expectations, for example in order
to make predictions. The fundamental problem that we therefore wish to address in
this chapter involves ﬁnding the expectation of some function f(z) with respect to a
probability distribution p(z). Here, the components of z might comprise discrete or
continuous variables or some combination of the two. Thus in the case of continuous

E[f] =

(11.1)

where the integral is replaced by summation in the case of discrete variables. This
is illustrated schematically for a single continuous variable in Figure 11.1. We shall
suppose that such expectations are too complex to be evaluated exactly using analyt-
ical techniques.

The general idea behind sampling methods is to obtain a set of samples z(l)
(where l = 1, . . . , L) drawn independently from the distribution p(z). This allows
the expectation (11.1) to be approximated by a ﬁnite sum

As long as the samples z(l) are drawn from the distribution p(z), then E[(cid:1)f] = E[f]
and so the estimator(cid:1)f has the correct mean. The variance of the estimator is given

is the variance of the function f(z) under the distribution p(z). It is worth emphasiz-
ing that the accuracy of the estimator therefore does not depend on the dimension-
ality of z, and that, in principle, high accuracy may be achievable with a relatively
small number of samples z(l). In practice, ten or twenty independent samples may
sufﬁce to estimate an expectation to sufﬁcient accuracy.
The problem, however, is that the samples {z(l)} might not be independent, and
so the effective sample size might be much smaller than the apparent sample size.
Also, referring back to Figure 11.1, we note that if f(z) is small in regions where
p(z) is large, and vice versa, then the expectation may be dominated by regions
of small probability, implying that relatively large sample sizes will be required to
achieve sufﬁcient accuracy.

For many models, the joint distribution p(z) is conveniently speciﬁed in terms
of a graphical model. In the case of a directed graph with no observed variables, it is

11. SAMPLING METHODS

525

straightforward to sample from the joint distribution (assuming that it is possible to
sample from the conditional distributions at each node) using the following ances-
tral sampling approach, discussed brieﬂy in Section 8.1.2. The joint distribution is
speciﬁed by

M(cid:14)

p(z) =

p(zi|pai)

(11.4)

i=1

where zi are the set of variables associated with node i, and pai denotes the set of
variables associated with the parents of node i. To obtain a sample from the joint
distribution, we make one pass through the set of variables in the order z1, . . . , zM
sampling from the conditional distributions p(zi|pai). This is always possible be-
cause at each step all of the parent values will have been instantiated. After one pass
through the graph, we will have obtained a sample from the joint distribution.

Now consider the case of a directed graph in which some of the nodes are in-
stantiated with observed values. We can in principle extend the above procedure, at
least in the case of nodes representing discrete variables, to give the following logic
sampling approach (Henrion, 1988), which can be seen as a special case of impor-
tance sampling discussed in Section 11.1.4. At each step, when a sampled value is
obtained for a variable zi whose value is observed, the sampled value is compared
to the observed value, and if they agree then the sample value is retained and the al-
gorithm proceeds to the next variable in turn. However, if the sampled value and the
observed value disagree, then the whole sample so far is discarded and the algorithm
starts again with the ﬁrst node in the graph. This algorithm samples correctly from
the posterior distribution because it corresponds simply to drawing samples from the
joint distribution of hidden variables and data variables and then discarding those
samples that disagree with the observed data (with the slight saving of not continu-
ing with the sampling from the joint distribution as soon as one contradictory value is
observed). However, the overall probability of accepting a sample from the posterior
decreases rapidly as the number of observed variables increases and as the number
of states that those variables can take increases, and so this approach is rarely used
in practice.

In the case of probability distributions deﬁned by an undirected graph, there is
no one-pass sampling strategy that will sample even from the prior distribution with
no observed variables. Instead, computationally more expensive techniques must be
employed, such as Gibbs sampling, which is discussed in Section 11.3.

As well as sampling from conditional distributions, we may also require samples
from a marginal distribution. If we already have a strategy for sampling from a joint
distribution p(u, v), then it is straightforward to obtain samples from the marginal
distribution p(u) simply by ignoring the values for v in each sample.

There are numerous texts dealing with Monte Carlo methods. Those of partic-
ular interest from the statistical inference perspective include Chen et al. (2001),
Gamerman (1997), Gilks et al. (1996), Liu (2001), Neal (1996), and Robert and

11.1. Basic Sampling Algorithms

In this section, we consider some simple strategies for generating random samples
from a given distribution. Because the samples will be generated by a computer
algorithm they will in fact be pseudo-random numbers, that is, they will be deter-
ministically calculated, but must nevertheless pass appropriate tests for randomness.
Generating such numbers raises several subtleties (Press et al., 1992) that lie outside
the scope of this book. Here we shall assume that an algorithm has been provided
that generates pseudo-random numbers distributed uniformly over (0, 1), and indeed
most software environments have such a facility built in.

11.1.1 Standard distributions
We ﬁrst consider how to generate random numbers from simple nonuniform dis-
tributions, assuming that we already have available a source of uniformly distributed
random numbers. Suppose that z is uniformly distributed over the interval (0, 1),
and that we transform the values of z using some function f(·) so that y = f(z).
The distribution of y will be governed by

p(y) = p(z)

(11.5)

Exercise 11.2

z = h(y) ≡

where, in this case, p(z) = 1. Our goal is to choose the function f(z) such that the
resulting values of y have some speciﬁc desired distribution p(y). Integrating (11.5)
we obtain

(cid:6) y

which is the indeﬁnite integral of p(y). Thus, y = h
transform the uniformly distributed random numbers using a function which is the
inverse of the indeﬁnite integral of the desired distribution. This is illustrated in
Figure 11.2.

Consider for example the exponential distribution
p(y) = λ exp(−λy)

(11.7)
where 0 (cid:1) y < ∞. In this case the lower limit of the integral in (11.6) is 0, and so
h(y) = 1 − exp(−λy). Thus, if we transform our uniformly distributed variable z
using y = −λ

−1 ln(1 − z), then y will have an exponential distribution.

In this case, the inverse of the indeﬁnite integral can be expressed in terms of the

As a ﬁnal example of the transformation method we consider the Box-Muller
method for generating samples from a Gaussian distribution. First, suppose we gen-
erate pairs of uniformly distributed random numbers z1, z2 ∈ (−1, 1), which we can
do by transforming a variable distributed uniformly over (0, 1) using z → 2z − 1.

and so y1 and y2 are independent and each has a Gaussian distribution with zero
mean and unit variance.

If y has a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance, then σy + µ
will have a Gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance σ2. To generate vector-
valued variables having a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean µ and co-
variance Σ, we can make use of the Cholesky decomposition, which takes the form
Σ = LLT (Press et al., 1992). Then, if z is a vector valued random variable whose
components are independent and Gaussian distributed with zero mean and unit vari-
ance, then y = µ + Lz will have mean µ and covariance Σ.

Obviously, the transformation technique depends for its success on the ability
to calculate and then invert the indeﬁnite integral of the required distribution. Such
operations will only be feasible for a limited number of simple distributions, and so
we must turn to alternative approaches in search of a more general strategy. Here
we consider two techniques called rejection sampling and importance sampling. Al-
though mainly limited to univariate distributions and thus not directly applicable to
complex problems in many dimensions, they do form important components in more
general strategies.

11.1.2 Rejection sampling
The rejection sampling framework allows us to sample from relatively complex
distributions, subject to certain constraints. We begin by considering univariate dis-
tributions and discuss the extension to multiple dimensions subsequently.

Suppose we wish to sample from a distribution p(z) that is not one of the simple,
standard distributions considered so far, and that sampling directly from p(z) is dif-
ﬁcult. Furthermore suppose, as is often the case, that we are easily able to evaluate
p(z) for any given value of z, up to some normalizing constant Z, so that

(cid:4)p(z)

where(cid:4)p(z) can readily be evaluated, but Zp is unknown.

p(z) =

In order to apply rejection sampling, we need some simpler distribution q(z),
sometimes called a proposal distribution, from which we can readily draw samples.

(11.13)

Figure 11.4 In the rejection sampling method,
samples are drawn from a sim-
ple distribution q(z) and rejected
if they fall
in the grey area be-
tween the unnormalized distribu-
tion ep(z) and the scaled distribu-
tion kq(z). The resulting samples
are distributed according to p(z),
which is the normalized version of
ep(z).

We next introduce a constant k whose value is chosen such that kq(z) (cid:2)(cid:4)p(z) for

all values of z. The function kq(z) is called the comparison function and is illus-
trated for a univariate distribution in Figure 11.4. Each step of the rejection sampler
involves generating two random numbers. First, we generate a number z0 from the
distribution q(z). Next, we generate a number u0 from the uniform distribution over
[0, kq(z0)]. This pair of random numbers has uniform distribution under the curve

of the function kq(z). Finally, if u0 >(cid:4)p(z0) then the sample is rejected, otherwise
ure 11.4. The remaining pairs then have uniform distribution under the curve of(cid:4)p(z),
ples are then accepted with probability(cid:4)p(z)/kq(z), and so the probability that a

and hence the corresponding z values are distributed according to p(z), as desired.
The original values of z are generated from the distribution q(z), and these sam-

u0 is retained. Thus the pair is rejected if it lies in the grey shaded region in Fig-

We therefore see that the constant k should be as small as possible subject to the

As an illustration of the use of rejection sampling, consider the task of sampling

from the gamma distribution

Gam(z|a, b) = baza−1 exp(−bz)

Γ(a)

(11.15)

which, for a > 1, has a bell-shaped form, as shown in Figure 11.5. A suitable
proposal distribution is therefore the Cauchy (11.8) because this too is bell-shaped
and because we can use the transformation method, discussed earlier, to sample from
it. We need to generalize the Cauchy slightly to ensure that it nowhere has a smaller
value than the gamma distribution. This can be achieved by transforming a uniform
random variable y using z = b tan y + c, which gives random numbers distributed
according to.

11.1.3 Adaptive rejection sampling
In many instances where we might wish to apply rejection sampling, it proves
difﬁcult to determine a suitable analytic form for the envelope distribution q(z). An
alternative approach is to construct the envelope function on the ﬂy based on mea-
sured values of the distribution p(z) (Gilks and Wild, 1992). Construction of an
envelope function is particularly straightforward for cases in which p(z) is log con-
cave, in other words when ln p(z) has derivatives that are nonincreasing functions
of z. The construction of a suitable envelope function is illustrated graphically in
Figure 11.6.

The function ln p(z) and its gradient are evaluated at some initial set of grid
points, and the intersections of the resulting tangent lines are used to construct the
envelope function. Next a sample value is drawn from the envelope distribution.
This is straightforward because the log of the envelope distribution is a succession

Exercise 11.9

Figure 11.6 In the case of distributions that are
log concave, an envelope function
for use in rejection sampling can be
constructed using the tangent lines
computed at a set of grid points. If a
sample point is rejected, it is added
to the set of grid points and used to
reﬁne the envelope distribution.

of linear functions, and hence the envelope distribution itself comprises a piecewise
exponential distribution of the form

q(z) = kiλi exp{−λi(z − zi−1)}

zi−1 < z (cid:1) zi.

(11.17)

Once a sample has been drawn, the usual rejection criterion can be applied. If the
sample is accepted, then it will be a draw from the desired distribution. If, however,
the sample is rejected, then it is incorporated into the set of grid points, a new tangent
line is computed, and the envelope function is thereby reﬁned. As the number of
grid points increases, so the envelope function becomes a better approximation of
the desired distribution p(z) and the probability of rejection decreases.

A variant of the algorithm exists that avoids the evaluation of derivatives (Gilks,
1992). The adaptive rejection sampling framework can also be extended to distri-
butions that are not log concave, simply by following each rejection sampling step
with a Metropolis-Hastings step (to be discussed in Section 11.2.2), giving rise to
adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling (Gilks et al., 1995).

Clearly for rejection sampling to be of practical value, we require that the com-
parison function be close to the required distribution so that the rate of rejection is
kept to a minimum. Now let us examine what happens when we try to use rejection
sampling in spaces of high dimensionality. Consider, for the sake of illustration,
a somewhat artiﬁcial problem in which we wish to sample from a zero-mean mul-
tivariate Gaussian distribution with covariance σ2
pI, where I is the unit matrix, by
rejection sampling from a proposal distribution that is itself a zero-mean Gaussian
distribution having covariance σ2
p in order that
there exists a k such that kq(z) (cid:2) p(z). In D-dimensions the optimum value of k
is given by k = (σq/σp)D, as illustrated for D = 1 in Figure 11.7. The acceptance
rate will be the ratio of volumes under p(z) and kq(z), which, because both distribu-
tions are normalized, is just 1/k. Thus the acceptance rate diminishes exponentially
with dimensionality. Even if σq exceeds σp by just one percent, for D = 1, 000 the
acceptance ratio will be approximately 1/20, 000. In this illustrative example the
comparison function is close to the required distribution. For more practical exam-
ples, where the desired distribution may be multimodal and sharply peaked, it will
be extremely difﬁcult to ﬁnd a good proposal distribution and comparison function.

Furthermore, the exponential decrease of acceptance rate with dimensionality is a
generic feature of rejection sampling. Although rejection can be a useful technique
in one or two dimensions it is unsuited to problems of high dimensionality. It can,
however, play a role as a subroutine in more sophisticated algorithms for sampling
in high dimensional spaces.

11.1.4 Importance sampling
One of the principal reasons for wishing to sample from complicated probability
distributions is to be able to evaluate expectations of the form (11.1). The technique
of importance sampling provides a framework for approximating expectations di-
rectly but does not itself provide a mechanism for drawing samples from distribution
p(z).

The ﬁnite sum approximation to the expectation, given by (11.2), depends on
being able to draw samples from the distribution p(z). Suppose, however, that it is
impractical to sample directly from p(z) but that we can evaluate p(z) easily for any
given value of z. One simplistic strategy for evaluating expectations would be to
discretize z-space into a uniform grid and to evaluate the integrand as a sum of the
form

E[f] (cid:7) L(cid:2)

p(z(l))f(z(l)).

(11.18)

l=1

An obvious problem with this approach is that the number of terms in the summation
grows exponentially with the dimensionality of z. Furthermore, as we have already
noted, the kinds of probability distributions of interest will often have much of their
mass conﬁned to relatively small regions of z space and so uniform sampling will be
very inefﬁcient because in high-dimensional problems, only a very small proportion
of the samples will make a signiﬁcant contribution to the sum. We would really like
to choose the sample points to fall in regions where p(z) is large, or ideally where
the product p(z)f(z) is large.

As in the case of rejection sampling, importance sampling is based on the use
of a proposal distribution q(z) from which it is easy to draw samples, as illustrated
in Figure 11.8. We can then express the expectation in the form of a ﬁnite sum over

As with rejection sampling, the success of the importance sampling approach
depends crucially on how well the sampling distribution q(z) matches the desired

distribution p(z). If, as is often the case, p(z)f(z) is strongly varying and has a sig-
niﬁcant proportion of its mass concentrated over relatively small regions of z space,
then the set of importance weights {rl} may be dominated by a few weights hav-
ing large values, with the remaining weights being relatively insigniﬁcant. Thus the
effective sample size can be much smaller than the apparent sample size L. The prob-
lem is even more severe if none of the samples falls in the regions where p(z)f(z)
is large. In that case, the apparent variances of rl and rlf(z(l)) may be small even
though the estimate of the expectation may be severely wrong. Hence a major draw-
back of the importance sampling method is the potential to produce results that are
arbitrarily in error and with no diagnostic indication. This also highlights a key re-
quirement for the sampling distribution q(z), namely that it should not be small or
zero in regions where p(z) may be signiﬁcant.

For distributions deﬁned in terms of a graphical model, we can apply the impor-
tance sampling technique in various ways. For discrete variables, a simple approach
is called uniform sampling. The joint distribution for a directed graph is deﬁned
by (11.4). Each sample from the joint distribution is obtained by ﬁrst setting those
variables zi that are in the evidence set equal to their observed values. Each of the
remaining variables is then sampled independently from a uniform distribution over
the space of possible instantiations. To determine the corresponding weight associ-

ated with a sample z(l), we note that the sampling distribution(cid:4)q(z) is uniform over
the possible choices for z, and that(cid:4)p(z|x) =(cid:4)p(z), where x denotes the subset of

variables that are observed, and the equality follows from the fact that every sample
z that is generated is necessarily consistent with the evidence. Thus the weights rl
are simply proportional to p(z). Note that the variables can be sampled in any order.
This approach can yield poor results if the posterior distribution is far from uniform,
as is often the case in practice.

An improvement on this approach is called likelihood weighted sampling (Fung
and Chang, 1990; Shachter and Peot, 1990) and is based on ancestral sampling of
the variables. For each variable in turn, if that variable is in the evidence set, then it
is just set to its instantiated value. If it is not in the evidence set, then it is sampled
from the conditional distribution p(zi|pai) in which the conditioning variables are
set to their currently sampled values. The weighting associated with the resulting
sample z is then given by

p(zi|pai)

p(zi|pai).

This method can be further extended using self-importance sampling (Shachter and
Peot, 1990) in which the importance sampling distribution is continually updated to
reﬂect the current estimated posterior distribution.

11.1.5 Sampling-importance-resampling
The rejection sampling method discussed in Section 11.1.2 depends in part for
its success on the determination of a suitable value for the constant k. For many
pairs of distributions p(z) and q(z), it will be impractical to determine a suitable

11.1. Basic Sampling Algorithms

535

value for k in that any value that is sufﬁciently large to guarantee a bound on the
desired distribution will lead to impractically small acceptance rates.

As in the case of rejection sampling, the sampling-importance-resampling (SIR)
approach also makes use of a sampling distribution q(z) but avoids having to de-
termine the constant k. There are two stages to the scheme.
In the ﬁrst stage,
L samples z(1), . . . , z(L) are drawn from q(z). Then in the second stage, weights
w1, . . . , wL are constructed using (11.23). Finally, a second set of L samples is
drawn from the discrete distribution (z(1), . . . , z(L)) with probabilities given by the
weights (w1, . . . , wL).
The resulting L samples are only approximately distributed according to p(z),
but the distribution becomes correct in the limit L → ∞. To see this, consider the
univariate case, and note that the cumulative distribution of the resampled values is
given by

(cid:2)
(cid:5)
l I(z(l) (cid:1) a)(cid:4)p(z(l))/q(z(l))
(cid:5)
l(cid:4)p(z(l))/q(z(l))

l:z(l)(cid:1)a

wl

p(z (cid:1) a) =

=

(11.25)

where I(.) is the indicator function (which equals 1 if its argument is true and 0
otherwise). Taking the limit L → ∞, and assuming suitable regularity of the dis-
tributions, we can replace the sums by integrals weighted according to the original
sampling distribution q(z)

(cid:6)
(cid:6)
(cid:6)

I(z (cid:1) a){(cid:4)p(z)/q(z)} q(z) dz
(cid:6)
{(cid:4)p(z)/q(z)} q(z) dz
I(z (cid:1) a)(cid:4)p(z) dz
(cid:6) (cid:4)p(z) dz

p(z (cid:1) a) =

=

=

I(z (cid:1) a)p(z) dz

(11.26)

which is the cumulative distribution function of p(z). Again, we see that the normal-
ization of p(z) is not required.

For a ﬁnite value of L, and a given initial sample set, the resampled values will
only approximately be drawn from the desired distribution. As with rejection sam-
pling, the approximation improves as the sampling distribution q(z) gets closer to
the desired distribution p(z). When q(z) = p(z), the initial samples (z(1), . . . , z(L))
have the desired distribution, and the weights wn = 1/L so that the resampled values
also have the desired distribution.

If moments with respect to the distribution p(z) are required, then they can be

11.1.6 Sampling and the EM algorithm
In addition to providing a mechanism for direct implementation of the Bayesian
framework, Monte Carlo methods can also play a role in the frequentist paradigm,
for example to ﬁnd maximum likelihood solutions. In particular, sampling methods
can be used to approximate the E step of the EM algorithm for models in which the
E step cannot be performed analytically. Consider a model with hidden variables
Z, visible (observed) variables X, and parameters θ. The function that is optimized
with respect to θ in the M step is the expected complete-data log likelihood, given
by

(cid:6)

Q(θ, θold) =

p(Z|X, θold) ln p(Z, X|θ) dZ.

(11.28)

We can use sampling methods to approximate this integral by a ﬁnite sum over sam-
ples {Z(l)}, which are drawn from the current estimate for the posterior distribution
p(Z|X, θold), so that

Q(θ, θold) (cid:7) 1
L

ln p(Z(l), X|θ).

(11.29)

L(cid:2)

l=1

The Q function is then optimized in the usual way in the M step. This procedure is
called the Monte Carlo EM algorithm.

It is straightforward to extend this to the problem of ﬁnding the mode of the
posterior distribution over θ (the MAP estimate) when a prior distribution p(θ) has
been deﬁned, simply by adding ln p(θ) to the function Q(θ, θold) before performing
the M step.

A particular instance of the Monte Carlo EM algorithm, called stochastic EM,
arises if we consider a ﬁnite mixture model, and draw just one sample at each E step.
Here the latent variable Z characterizes which of the K components of the mixture
is responsible for generating each data point. In the E step, a sample of Z is taken
from the posterior distribution p(Z|X, θold) where X is the data set. This effectively
makes a hard assignment of each data point to one of the components in the mixture.
In the M step, this sampled approximation to the posterior distribution is used to
update the model parameters in the usual way.

11.2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo

537

Now suppose we move from a maximum likelihood approach to a full Bayesian
treatment in which we wish to sample from the posterior distribution over the param-
eter vector θ. In principle, we would like to draw samples from the joint posterior
p(θ, Z|X), but we shall suppose that this is computationally difﬁcult. Suppose fur-
ther that it is relatively straightforward to sample from the complete-data parameter
posterior p(θ|Z, X). This inspires the data augmentation algorithm, which alter-
nates between two steps known as the I-step (imputation step, analogous to an E
step) and the P-step (posterior step, analogous to an M step).

I-step. We wish to sample from p(Z|X) but we cannot do this directly. We

therefore note the relation

p(Z|X) =

p(Z|θ, X)p(θ|X) dθ

(11.30)

(cid:6)

(cid:6)

L(cid:2)

l=1

and hence for l = 1, . . . , L we ﬁrst draw a sample θ(l) from the current esti-
mate for p(θ|X), and then use this to draw a sample Z(l) from p(Z|θ(l), X).

P-step. Given the relation

p(θ|X) =

p(θ|Z, X)p(Z|X) dZ

(11.31)
we use the samples {Z(l)} obtained from the I-step to compute a revised
estimate of the posterior distribution over θ given by

p(θ|X) (cid:7) 1
L

p(θ|Z(l), X).

(11.32)

By assumption, it will be feasible to sample from this approximation in the
I-step.

Note that we are making a (somewhat artiﬁcial) distinction between parameters θ
and hidden variables Z. From now on, we blur this distinction and focus simply on
the problem of drawing samples from a given posterior distribution.

11.2. Markov Chain Monte Carlo

In the previous section, we discussed the rejection sampling and importance sam-
pling strategies for evaluating expectations of functions, and we saw that they suffer
from severe limitations particularly in spaces of high dimensionality. We therefore
turn in this section to a very general and powerful framework called Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC), which allows sampling from a large class of distributions,

538

11. SAMPLING METHODS

and which scales well with the dimensionality of the sample space. Markov chain
Monte Carlo methods have their origins in physics (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949),
and it was only towards the end of the 1980s that they started to have a signiﬁcant
impact in the ﬁeld of statistics.

As with rejection and importance sampling, we again sample from a proposal
distribution. This time, however, we maintain a record of the current state z(τ ), and
the proposal distribution q(z|z(τ )) depends on this current state, and so the sequence

of samples z(1), z(2), . . . forms a Markov chain. Again, if we write p(z) =(cid:4)p(z)/Zp,
we will assume that(cid:4)p(z) can readily be evaluated for any given value of z, although

Section 11.2.1

the value of Zp may be unknown. The proposal distribution itself is chosen to be
sufﬁciently simple that it is straightforward to draw samples from it directly. At
each cycle of the algorithm, we generate a candidate sample z(cid:1) from the proposal
distribution and then accept the sample according to an appropriate criterion.
In the basic Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953), we assume that the
proposal distribution is symmetric, that is q(zA|zB) = q(zB|zA) for all values of
zA and zB. The candidate sample is then accepted with probability

A(z(cid:1), z(τ )) = min

1,

.

(11.33)

(cid:15)

(cid:16)

(cid:4)p(z(cid:1))
(cid:4)p(z(τ ))

This can be achieved by choosing a random number u with uniform distribution over
the unit interval (0, 1) and then accepting the sample if A(z(cid:1), z(τ )) > u. Note that
if the step from z(τ ) to z(cid:1) causes an increase in the value of p(z), then the candidate
point is certain to be kept.

If the candidate sample is accepted, then z(τ +1) = z(cid:1), otherwise the candidate
point z(cid:1) is discarded, z(τ +1) is set to z(τ ) and another candidate sample is drawn
from the distribution q(z|z(τ +1)). This is in contrast to rejection sampling, where re-
jected samples are simply discarded. In the Metropolis algorithm when a candidate
point is rejected, the previous sample is included instead in the ﬁnal list of samples,
leading to multiple copies of samples. Of course, in a practical implementation,
only a single copy of each retained sample would be kept, along with an integer
weighting factor recording how many times that state appears. As we shall see, as
long as q(zA|zB) is positive for any values of zA and zB (this is a sufﬁcient but
not necessary condition), the distribution of z(τ ) tends to p(z) as τ → ∞. It should
be emphasized, however, that the sequence z(1), z(2), . . . is not a set of independent
samples from p(z) because successive samples are highly correlated. If we wish to
obtain independent samples, then we can discard most of the sequence and just re-
tain every M th sample. For M sufﬁciently large, the retained samples will for all
practical purposes be independent. Figure 11.9 shows a simple illustrative exam-
ple of sampling from a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution using the Metropolis
algorithm in which the proposal distribution is an isotropic Gaussian.

Further insight into the nature of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms can be
gleaned by looking at the properties of a speciﬁc example, namely a simple random

walk. Consider a state space z consisting of the integers, with probabilities

p(z(τ +1) = z(τ )) = 0.5
p(z(τ +1) = z(τ ) + 1) = 0.25
p(z(τ +1) = z(τ ) − 1) = 0.25

(11.34)
(11.35)
(11.36)

where z(τ ) denotes the state at step τ . If the initial state is z(1) = 0, then by sym-
metry the expected state at time τ will also be zero E[z(τ )] = 0, and similarly it is
easily seen that E[(z(τ ))2] = τ /2. Thus after τ steps, the random walk has only trav-
elled a distance that on average is proportional to the square root of τ . This square
root dependence is typical of random walk behaviour and shows that random walks
are very inefﬁcient in exploring the state space. As we shall see, a central goal in
designing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is to avoid random walk behaviour.

11.2.1 Markov chains
Before discussing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in more detail, it is use-
ful to study some general properties of Markov chains in more detail. In particular,
we ask under what circumstances will a Markov chain converge to the desired dis-
tribution. A ﬁrst-order Markov chain is deﬁned to be a series of random variables
z(1), . . . , z(M ) such that the following conditional independence property holds for
m ∈ {1, . . . , M − 1}

p(z(m+1)|z(1), . . . , z(m)) = p(z(m+1)|z(m)).

(11.37)

This of course can be represented as a directed graph in the form of a chain, an ex-
ample of which is shown in Figure 8.38. We can then specify the Markov chain by
giving the probability distribution for the initial variable p(z(0)) together with the

540

11. SAMPLING METHODS

(cid:2)

conditional probabilities for subsequent variables in the form of transition probabil-
ities Tm(z(m), z(m+1)) ≡ p(z(m+1)|z(m)). A Markov chain is called homogeneous
if the transition probabilities are the same for all m.

The marginal probability for a particular variable can be expressed in terms of

the marginal probability for the previous variable in the chain in the form

p(z(m+1)) =

p(z(m+1)|z(m))p(z(m)).

(11.38)

z(m)

A distribution is said to be invariant, or stationary, with respect to a Markov chain
if each step in the chain leaves that distribution invariant. Thus, for a homogeneous
Markov chain with transition probabilities T (z(cid:4)
, z), the distribution p(cid:1)(z) is invariant
if
, z)p(cid:1)(z(cid:4)).
T (z(cid:4)

(cid:2)

p(cid:1)(z) =

(11.39)

z(cid:1)

Note that a given Markov chain may have more than one invariant distribution. For
instance, if the transition probabilities are given by the identity transformation, then
any distribution will be invariant.

A sufﬁcient (but not necessary) condition for ensuring that the required distribu-
tion p(z) is invariant is to choose the transition probabilities to satisfy the property
of detailed balance, deﬁned by

p(cid:1)(z)T (z, z(cid:4)) = p(cid:1)(z(cid:4))T (z(cid:4)

, z)

(11.40)

for the particular distribution p(cid:1)(z).
It is easily seen that a transition probability
that satisﬁes detailed balance with respect to a particular distribution will leave that
distribution invariant, because

p(cid:1)(z(cid:4))T (z(cid:4)

, z) =

p(cid:1)(z)T (z, z(cid:4)) = p(cid:1)(z)

p(z(cid:4)|z) = p(cid:1)(z).

(11.41)

(cid:2)

z(cid:1)

A Markov chain that respects detailed balance is said to be reversible.

Our goal is to use Markov chains to sample from a given distribution. We can
achieve this if we set up a Markov chain such that the desired distribution is invariant.
However, we must also require that for m → ∞, the distribution p(z(m)) converges
to the required invariant distribution p(cid:1)(z), irrespective of the choice of initial dis-
tribution p(z(0)). This property is called ergodicity, and the invariant distribution
is then called the equilibrium distribution. Clearly, an ergodic Markov chain can
have only one equilibrium distribution. It can be shown that a homogeneous Markov
chain will be ergodic, subject only to weak restrictions on the invariant distribution
and the transition probabilities (Neal, 1993).

In practice we often construct the transition probabilities from a set of ‘base’
transitions B1, . . . , BK. This can be achieved through a mixture distribution of the
form

T (z(cid:4)

, z) =

αkBk(z(cid:4)

for some set of mixing coefﬁcients α1, . . . , αK satisfying αk (cid:2) 0 and

Alternatively, the base transitions may be combined through successive application,

If a distribution is invariant with respect to each of the base transitions, then obvi-
ously it will also be invariant with respect to either of the T (z(cid:4)
, z) given by (11.42)
or (11.43). For the case of the mixture (11.42), if each of the base transitions sat-
isﬁes detailed balance, then the mixture transition T will also satisfy detailed bal-
ance. This does not hold for the transition probability constructed using (11.43), al-
though by symmetrizing the order of application of the base transitions, in the form
B1, B2, . . . , BK, BK, . . . , B2, B1, detailed balance can be restored. A common ex-
ample of the use of composite transition probabilities is where each base transition
changes only a subset of the variables.

11.2.2 The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
Earlier we introduced the basic Metropolis algorithm, without actually demon-
strating that it samples from the required distribution. Before giving a proof, we
ﬁrst discuss a generalization, known as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hast-
ings, 1970), to the case where the proposal distribution is no longer a symmetric
function of its arguments. In particular at step τ of the algorithm, in which the cur-
rent state is z(τ ), we draw a sample z(cid:1) from the distribution qk(z|z(τ )) and then
accept it with probability Ak(z(cid:1), zτ ) where

(cid:15)

(cid:16)

(cid:4)p(z(cid:1))qk(z(τ )|z(cid:1))
(cid:4)p(z(τ ))qk(z(cid:1)|z(τ ))

Ak(z(cid:1), z(τ )) = min

1,

.

(11.44)

Here k labels the members of the set of possible transitions being considered. Again,
the evaluation of the acceptance criterion does not require knowledge of the normal-

izing constant Zp in the probability distribution p(z) =(cid:4)p(z)/Zp. For a symmetric

proposal distribution the Metropolis-Hastings criterion (11.44) reduces to the stan-
dard Metropolis criterion given by (11.33).

We can show that p(z) is an invariant distribution of the Markov chain deﬁned
by the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by showing that detailed balance, deﬁned by
(11.40), is satisﬁed. Using (11.44) we have

p(z)qk(z|z(cid:4))Ak(z(cid:4)

, z) = min (p(z)qk(z|z(cid:4)), p(z(cid:4))qk(z(cid:4)|z))
= min (p(z(cid:4))qk(z(cid:4)|z), p(z)qk(z|z(cid:4)))
= p(z(cid:4))qk(z(cid:4)|z)Ak(z, z(cid:4))

(11.45)

as required.

The speciﬁc choice of proposal distribution can have a marked effect on the
performance of the algorithm. For continuous state spaces, a common choice is a
Gaussian centred on the current state, leading to an important trade-off in determin-
If the variance is small, then the
ing the variance parameter of this distribution.

11. SAMPLING METHODS

Figure 11.10 Schematic illustration of the use of an isotropic
Gaussian proposal distribution (blue circle) to
sample from a correlated multivariate Gaussian
distribution (red ellipse) having very different stan-
dard deviations in different directions, using the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
In order to keep
the rejection rate low, the scale ρ of the proposal
distribution should be on the order of the smallest
standard deviation σmin, which leads to random
walk behaviour in which the number of steps sep-
arating states that are approximately independent
is of order (σmax/σmin)2 where σmax is the largest
standard deviation.

proportion of accepted transitions will be high, but progress through the state space
takes the form of a slow random walk leading to long correlation times. However,
if the variance parameter is large, then the rejection rate will be high because, in the
kind of complex problems we are considering, many of the proposed steps will be
to states for which the probability p(z) is low. Consider a multivariate distribution
p(z) having strong correlations between the components of z, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 11.10. The scale ρ of the proposal distribution should be as large as possible
without incurring high rejection rates. This suggests that ρ should be of the same
order as the smallest length scale σmin. The system then explores the distribution
along the more extended direction by means of a random walk, and so the number
of steps to arrive at a state that is more or less independent of the original state is
of order (σmax/σmin)2. In fact in two dimensions, the increase in rejection rate as ρ
increases is offset by the larger steps sizes of those transitions that are accepted, and
more generally for a multivariate Gaussian the number of steps required to obtain
independent samples scales like (σmax/σ2)2 where σ2 is the second-smallest stan-
dard deviation (Neal, 1993). These details aside, it remains the case that if the length
scales over which the distributions vary are very different in different directions, then
the Metropolis Hastings algorithm can have very slow convergence.

11.3. Gibbs Sampling

Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984) is a simple and widely applicable Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm and can be seen as a special case of the Metropolis-
Hastings algorithm.

Consider the distribution p(z) = p(z1, . . . , zM ) from which we wish to sample,
and suppose that we have chosen some initial state for the Markov chain. Each step
of the Gibbs sampling procedure involves replacing the value of one of the variables
by a value drawn from the distribution of that variable conditioned on the values of
the remaining variables. Thus we replace zi by a value drawn from the distribution
p(zi|z\i), where zi denotes the ith component of z, and z\i denotes z1, . . . , zM but
with zi omitted. This procedure is repeated either by cycling through the variables

in some particular order or by choosing the variable to be updated at each step at
random from some distribution.

Josiah Willard Gibbs
1839–1903

Gibbs spent almost his entire life liv-
ing in a house built by his father in
New Haven, Connecticut.
In 1863,
Gibbs was granted the ﬁrst PhD in
engineering in the United States,
and in 1871 he was appointed to
the ﬁrst chair of mathematical physics in the United

States at Yale, a post for which he received no salary
because at the time he had no publications. He de-
veloped the ﬁeld of vector analysis and made contri-
butions to crystallography and planetary orbits. His
most famous work, entitled OntheEquilibriumofHet-
erogeneous Substances, laid the foundations for the
science of physical chemistry.

11. SAMPLING METHODS

To show that this procedure samples from the required distribution, we ﬁrst of
all note that the distribution p(z) is an invariant of each of the Gibbs sampling steps
individually and hence of the whole Markov chain. This follows from the fact that
when we sample from p(zi|{z\i), the marginal distribution p(z\i) is clearly invariant
because the value of z\i is unchanged. Also, each step by deﬁnition samples from the
correct conditional distribution p(zi|z\i). Because these conditional and marginal
distributions together specify the joint distribution, we see that the joint distribution
is itself invariant.

The second requirement to be satisﬁed in order that the Gibbs sampling proce-
dure samples from the correct distribution is that it be ergodic. A sufﬁcient condition
for ergodicity is that none of the conditional distributions be anywhere zero. If this
is the case, then any point in z space can be reached from any other point in a ﬁnite
number of steps involving one update of each of the component variables. If this
requirement is not satisﬁed, so that some of the conditional distributions have zeros,
then ergodicity, if it applies, must be proven explicitly.

The distribution of initial states must also be speciﬁed in order to complete the
algorithm, although samples drawn after many iterations will effectively become
independent of this distribution. Of course, successive samples from the Markov
chain will be highly correlated, and so to obtain samples that are nearly independent
it will be necessary to subsample the sequence.

We can obtain the Gibbs sampling procedure as a particular instance of the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as follows. Consider a Metropolis-Hastings sampling
step involving the variable zk in which the remaining variables z\k remain ﬁxed, and
for which the transition probability from z to z(cid:1) is given by qk(z(cid:1)|z) = p(z(cid:1)
k|z\k).
We note that z(cid:1)\k = z\k because these components are unchanged by the sampling
step. Also, p(z) = p(zk|z\k)p(z\k). Thus the factor that determines the acceptance
probability in the Metropolis-Hastings (11.44) is given by

A(z(cid:1), z) = p(z(cid:1))qk(z|z(cid:1))
p(z)qk(z(cid:1)|z)

=

k|z(cid:1)\k)p(z(cid:1)\k)p(zk|z(cid:1)\k)
k|z\k)

p(z(cid:1)
p(zk|z\k)p(z\k)p(z(cid:1)

= 1

(11.49)

where we have used z(cid:1)\k = z\k. Thus the Metropolis-Hastings steps are always
accepted.

As with the Metropolis algorithm, we can gain some insight into the behaviour of
Gibbs sampling by investigating its application to a Gaussian distribution. Consider
a correlated Gaussian in two variables, as illustrated in Figure 11.11, having con-
ditional distributions of width l and marginal distributions of width L. The typical
step size is governed by the conditional distributions and will be of order l. Because
the state evolves according to a random walk, the number of steps needed to obtain
independent samples from the distribution will be of order (L/l)2. Of course if the
Gaussian distribution were uncorrelated, then the Gibbs sampling procedure would
be optimally efﬁcient. For this simple problem, we could rotate the coordinate sys-
tem in order to decorrelate the variables. However, in practical applications it will
generally be infeasible to ﬁnd such transformations.

One approach to reducing random walk behaviour in Gibbs sampling is called
over-relaxation (Adler, 1981). In its original form, this applies to problems for which

The step size is governed by the stan-

bution (green curve), and is O(l), lead-
ing to slow progress in the direction of

to obtain an independent sample from
the distribution is O((L/l)2).

the conditional distributions are Gaussian, which represents a more general class of
distributions than the multivariate Gaussian because, for example, the non-Gaussian
distribution p(z, y) ∝ exp(−z2y2) has Gaussian conditional distributions. At each
step of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, the conditional distribution for a particular
component zi has some mean µi and some variance σ2
i . In the over-relaxation frame-
work, the value of zi is replaced with

i = µi + α(zi − µi) + σi(1 − α2
(cid:4)

i )1/2ν

z

(11.50)

i , then so too does z

where ν is a Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance, and α
is a parameter such that −1 < α < 1. For α = 0, the method is equivalent to
standard Gibbs sampling, and for α < 0 the step is biased to the opposite side of the
mean. This step leaves the desired distribution invariant because if zi has mean µi
(cid:4)
and variance σ2
i. The effect of over-relaxation is to encourage
directed motion through state space when the variables are highly correlated. The
framework of ordered over-relaxation (Neal, 1999) generalizes this approach to non-
Gaussian distributions.
The practical applicability of Gibbs sampling depends on the ease with which
samples can be drawn from the conditional distributions p(zk|z\k). In the case of
probability distributions speciﬁed using graphical models, the conditional distribu-
tions for individual nodes depend only on the variables in the corresponding Markov
blankets, as illustrated in Figure 11.12. For directed graphs, a wide choice of condi-
tional distributions for the individual nodes conditioned on their parents will lead to
conditional distributions for Gibbs sampling that are log concave. The adaptive re-
jection sampling methods discussed in Section 11.1.3 therefore provide a framework
for Monte Carlo sampling from directed graphs with broad applicability.

If the graph is constructed using distributions from the exponential family, and
if the parent-child relationships preserve conjugacy, then the full conditional distri-
butions arising in Gibbs sampling will have the same functional form as the orig-

546

11. SAMPLING METHODS

Figure 11.12 The Gibbs sampling method requires samples
to be drawn from the conditional distribution of a variable condi-
tioned on the remaining variables. For graphical models, this
conditional distribution is a function only of the states of the
nodes in the Markov blanket. For an undirected graph this com-
prises the set of neighbours, as shown on the left, while for a
directed graph the Markov blanket comprises the parents, the
children, and the co-parents, as shown on the right.

inal conditional distributions (conditioned on the parents) deﬁning each node, and
so standard sampling techniques can be employed. In general, the full conditional
distributions will be of a complex form that does not permit the use of standard sam-
pling algorithms. However, if these conditionals are log concave, then sampling can
be done efﬁciently using adaptive rejection sampling (assuming the corresponding
variable is a scalar).

If, at each stage of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, instead of drawing a sample
from the corresponding conditional distribution, we make a point estimate of the
variable given by the maximum of the conditional distribution, then we obtain the
iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm discussed in Section 8.3.3. Thus ICM
can be seen as a greedy approximation to Gibbs sampling.

Because the basic Gibbs sampling technique considers one variable at a time,
there are strong dependencies between successive samples. At the opposite extreme,
if we could draw samples directly from the joint distribution (an operation that we
are supposing is intractable), then successive samples would be independent. We can
hope to improve on the simple Gibbs sampler by adopting an intermediate strategy in
which we sample successively from groups of variables rather than individual vari-
ables. This is achieved in the blocking Gibbs sampling algorithm by choosing blocks
of variables, not necessarily disjoint, and then sampling jointly from the variables in
each block in turn, conditioned on the remaining variables (Jensen et al., 1995).

11.4. Slice Sampling

We have seen that one of the difﬁculties with the Metropolis algorithm is the sensi-
tivity to step size. If this is too small, the result is slow decorrelation due to random
walk behaviour, whereas if it is too large the result is inefﬁciency due to a high rejec-
tion rate. The technique of slice sampling (Neal, 2003) provides an adaptive step size
that is automatically adjusted to match the characteristics of the distribution. Again

it requires that we are able to evaluate the unnormalized distribution(cid:4)p(z).

Consider ﬁrst the univariate case. Slice sampling involves augmenting z with
an additional variable u and then drawing samples from the joint (z, u) space. We
shall see another example of this approach when we discuss hybrid Monte Carlo in
Section 11.5. The goal is to sample uniformly from the area under the distribution

and so we can sample from p(z) by sampling from(cid:1)p(z, u) and then ignoring the u

In practice, it can be difﬁcult to sample directly from a slice through the distribu-
tion and so instead we deﬁne a sampling scheme that leaves the uniform distribution

straightforward. Then we ﬁx u and sample z uniformly from the ‘slice’ through the

satisﬁed. Suppose the current value of z is denoted z(τ ) and that we have obtained
a corresponding sample u. The next value of z is obtained by considering a region
zmin (cid:1) z (cid:1) zmax that contains z(τ ). It is in the choice of this region that the adap-
tation to the characteristic length scales of the distribution takes place. We want the
region to encompass as much of the slice as possible so as to allow large moves in z
space while having as little as possible of this region lying outside the slice, because
this makes the sampling less efﬁcient.

One approach to the choice of region involves starting with a region containing
z(τ ) having some width w and then testing each of the end points to see if they lie
within the slice.
If either end point does not, then the region is extended in that
direction by increments of value w until the end point lies outside the region. A
is then chosen uniformly from this region, and if it lies within the
candidate value z
slice, then it forms z(τ +1). If it lies outside the slice, then the region is shrunk such
forms an end point and such that the region still contains z(τ ). Then another
that z

11. SAMPLING METHODS

candidate point is drawn uniformly from this reduced region and so on, until a value
of z is found that lies within the slice.

Slice sampling can be applied to multivariate distributions by repeatedly sam-
pling each variable in turn, in the manner of Gibbs sampling. This requires that
we are able to compute, for each component zi, a function that is proportional to
p(zi|z\i).

11.5. The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm

As we have already noted, one of the major limitations of the Metropolis algorithm
is that it can exhibit random walk behaviour whereby the distance traversed through
the state space grows only as the square root of the number of steps. The problem
cannot be resolved simply by taking bigger steps as this leads to a high rejection rate.
In this section, we introduce a more sophisticated class of transitions based on an
analogy with physical systems and that has the property of being able to make large
changes to the system state while keeping the rejection probability small. It is ap-
plicable to distributions over continuous variables for which we can readily evaluate
the gradient of the log probability with respect to the state variables. We will discuss
the dynamical systems framework in Section 11.5.1, and then in Section 11.5.2 we
explain how this may be combined with the Metropolis algorithm to yield the pow-
erful hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. A background in physics is not required as this
section is self-contained and the key results are all derived from ﬁrst principles.

11.5.1 Dynamical systems
The dynamical approach to stochastic sampling has its origins in algorithms for
simulating the behaviour of physical systems evolving under Hamiltonian dynam-
ics. In a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, the goal is to sample from a given
probability distribution p(z). The framework of Hamiltonian dynamics is exploited
by casting the probabilistic simulation in the form of a Hamiltonian system. In order
to remain in keeping with the literature in this area, we make use of the relevant
dynamical systems terminology where appropriate, which will be deﬁned as we go
along.
The dynamics that we consider corresponds to the evolution of the state variable
z = {zi} under continuous time, which we denote by τ . Classical dynamics is de-
scribed by Newton’s second law of motion in which the acceleration of an object is
proportional to the applied force, corresponding to a second-order differential equa-
tion over time. We can decompose a second-order equation into two coupled ﬁrst-
order equations by introducing intermediate momentum variables r, corresponding
to the rate of change of the state variables z, having components

ri =

dzi
dτ

(11.53)

where the zi can be regarded as position variables in this dynamics perspective. Thus

11.5. The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm

for each position variable there is a corresponding momentum variable, and the joint
space of position and momentum variables is called phase space.

Without loss of generality, we can write the probability distribution p(z) in the

form

p(z) =

exp (−E(z))

1
Zp

(11.54)

where E(z) is interpreted as the potential energy of the system when in state z. The
system acceleration is the rate of change of momentum and is given by the applied
force, which itself is the negative gradient of the potential energy

It is convenient to reformulate this dynamical system using the Hamiltonian

framework. To do this, we ﬁrst deﬁne the kinetic energy by

where H is the Hamiltonian function. Using (11.53), (11.55), (11.56), and (11.57),
we can now express the dynamics of the system in terms of the Hamiltonian equa-
tions given by

William Hamilton
1805–1865

William Rowan Hamilton was an
Irish mathematician and physicist,
and child prodigy, who was ap-
pointed Professor of Astronomy at
Trinity College, Dublin, in 1827, be-
fore he had even graduated. One
of Hamilton’s most important contributions was a new
formulation of dynamics, which played a signiﬁcant
role in the later development of quantum mechanics.

His other great achievement was the development of
quaternions, which generalize the concept of complex
numbers by introducing three distinct square roots of
minus one, which satisfy i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1.
It is said that these equations occurred to him while
walking along the Royal Canal in Dublin with his wife,
on 16 October 1843, and he promptly carved the
equations into the side of Broome bridge. Although
there is no longer any evidence of the carving, there is
now a stone plaque on the bridge commemorating the
discovery and displaying the quaternion equations.

A second important property of Hamiltonian dynamical systems, known as Li-
ouville’s Theorem, is that they preserve volume in phase space. In other words, if
we consider a region within the space of variables (z, r), then as this region evolves
under the equations of Hamiltonian dynamics, its shape may change but its volume
will not. This can be seen by noting that the ﬂow ﬁeld (rate of change of location in
phase space) is given by

Now consider the joint distribution over phase space whose total energy is the

Hamiltonian, i.e., the distribution given by

p(z, r) =

exp(−H(z, r)).

1
ZH

(11.63)

Using the two results of conservation of volume and conservation of H, it follows
that the Hamiltonian dynamics will leave p(z, r) invariant. This can be seen by
considering a small region of phase space over which H is approximately constant.
If we follow the evolution of the Hamiltonian equations for a ﬁnite time, then the
volume of this region will remain unchanged as will the value of H in this region, and
hence the probability density, which is a function only of H, will also be unchanged.
Although H is invariant, the values of z and r will vary, and so by integrating
the Hamiltonian dynamics over a ﬁnite time duration it becomes possible to make
large changes to z in a systematic way that avoids random walk behaviour.

Evolution under the Hamiltonian dynamics will not, however, sample ergodi-
cally from p(z, r) because the value of H is constant. In order to arrive at an ergodic
sampling scheme, we can introduce additional moves in phase space that change
the value of H while also leaving the distribution p(z, r) invariant. The simplest
way to achieve this is to replace the value of r with one drawn from its distribution
conditioned on z. This can be regarded as a Gibbs sampling step, and hence from

11.5. The Hybrid Monte Carlo Algorithm

551

Exercise 11.16

Section 11.3 we see that this also leaves the desired distribution invariant. Noting
that z and r are independent in the distribution p(z, r), we see that the conditional
distribution p(r|z) is a Gaussian from which it is straightforward to sample.

In a practical application of this approach, we have to address the problem of
performing a numerical integration of the Hamiltonian equations. This will neces-
sarily introduce numerical errors and so we should devise a scheme that minimizes
the impact of such errors. In fact, it turns out that integration schemes can be devised
for which Liouville’s theorem still holds exactly. This property will be important in
the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, which is discussed in Section 11.5.2. One scheme
for achieving this is called the leapfrog discretization and involves alternately updat-

ing discrete-time approximations(cid:1)z and(cid:1)r to the position and momentum variables

using

((cid:1)z(τ))
(cid:1)ri(τ + /2) = (cid:1)ri(τ) − 
(cid:1)zi(τ + ) = (cid:1)zi(τ) + (cid:1)ri(τ + /2)

(11.64)

(11.65)

(11.66)

We see that this takes the form of a half-step update of the momentum variables with
step size /2, followed by a full-step update of the position variables with step size ,
followed by a second half-step update of the momentum variables. If several leapfrog
steps are applied in succession, it can be seen that half-step updates to the momentum
variables can be combined into full-step updates with step size . The successive
updates to position and momentum variables then leapfrog over each other. In order
to advance the dynamics by a time interval τ , we need to take τ / steps. The error
involved in the discretized approximation to the continuous time dynamics will go to
zero, assuming a smooth function E(z), in the limit  → 0. However, for a nonzero
 as used in practice, some residual error will remain. We shall see in Section 11.5.2
how the effects of such errors can be eliminated in the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm.
In summary then, the Hamiltonian dynamical approach involves alternating be-
tween a series of leapfrog updates and a resampling of the momentum variables from
their marginal distribution.

Note that the Hamiltonian dynamics method, unlike the basic Metropolis algo-
rithm, is able to make use of information about the gradient of the log probability
distribution as well as about the distribution itself. An analogous situation is familiar
from the domain of function optimization. In most cases where gradient informa-
tion is available, it is highly advantageous to make use of it. Informally, this follows
from the fact that in a space of dimension D, the additional computational cost of
evaluating a gradient compared with evaluating the function itself will typically be a
ﬁxed factor independent of D, whereas the D-dimensional gradient vector conveys
D pieces of information compared with the one piece of information given by the
function itself.

552

11. SAMPLING METHODS

11.5.2 Hybrid Monte Carlo
As we discussed in the previous section, for a nonzero step size , the discretiza-
tion of the leapfrog algorithm will introduce errors into the integration of the Hamil-
tonian dynamical equations. Hybrid Monte Carlo (Duane et al., 1987; Neal, 1996)
combines Hamiltonian dynamics with the Metropolis algorithm and thereby removes
any bias associated with the discretization.

Speciﬁcally, the algorithm uses a Markov chain consisting of alternate stochastic
updates of the momentum variable r and Hamiltonian dynamical updates using the
leapfrog algorithm. After each application of the leapfrog algorithm, the resulting
candidate state is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis criterion based
on the value of the Hamiltonian H. Thus if (z, r) is the initial state and (z(cid:1), r(cid:1))
is the state after the leapfrog integration, then this candidate state is accepted with
probability

min (1, exp{H(z, r) − H(z(cid:1), r(cid:1))}) .

(11.67)

If the leapfrog integration were to simulate the Hamiltonian dynamics perfectly,
then every such candidate step would automatically be accepted because the value
of H would be unchanged. Due to numerical errors, the value of H may sometimes
decrease, and we would like the Metropolis criterion to remove any bias due to this
effect and ensure that the resulting samples are indeed drawn from the required dis-
tribution. In order for this to be the case, we need to ensure that the update equations
corresponding to the leapfrog integration satisfy detailed balance (11.40). This is
easily achieved by modifying the leapfrog scheme as follows.

Before the start of each leapfrog integration sequence, we choose at random,
with equal probability, whether to integrate forwards in time (using step size ) or
backwards in time (using step size −). We ﬁrst note that the leapfrog integration
scheme (11.64), (11.65), and (11.66) is time-reversible, so that integration for L steps
using step size − will exactly undo the effect of integration for L steps using step
size . Next we show that the leapfrog integration preserves phase-space volume
exactly. This follows from the fact that each step in the leapfrog scheme updates
either a zi variable or an ri variable by an amount that is a function only of the other
variable. As shown in Figure 11.14, this has the effect of shearing a region of phase
space while not altering its volume.
Finally, we use these results to show that detailed balance holds. Consider a
small region R of phase space that, under a sequence of L leapfrog iterations of
step size , maps to a region R(cid:4)
. Using conservation of volume under the leapfrog
iteration, we see that if R has volume δV then so too will R(cid:4)
. If we choose an initial
point from the distribution (11.63) and then update it using L leapfrog interactions,
the probability of the transition going from R to R(cid:4)

is given by

It is easily seen that the two probabilities (11.68) and (11.69) are equal, and hence
detailed balance holds. Note that this proof ignores any overlap between the regions
R and R(cid:4)

but is easily generalized to allow for such overlap.

It is not difﬁcult to construct examples for which the leapfrog algorithm returns
to its starting position after a ﬁnite number of iterations. In such cases, the random
replacement of the momentum values before each leapfrog integration will not be
sufﬁcient to ensure ergodicity because the position variables will never be updated.
Such phenomena are easily avoided by choosing the magnitude of the step size at
random from some small interval, before each leapfrog integration.

We can gain some insight into the behaviour of the hybrid Monte Carlo algo-
rithm by considering its application to a multivariate Gaussian. For convenience,
consider a Gaussian distribution p(z) with independent components, for which the
Hamiltonian is given by

(cid:2)

(11.70)

Our conclusions will be equally valid for a Gaussian distribution having correlated
components because the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm exhibits rotational isotropy.
During the leapfrog integration, each pair of phase-space variables zi, ri evolves in-
dependently. However, the acceptance or rejection of the candidate point is based
on the value of H, which depends on the values of all of the variables. Thus, a
signiﬁcant integration error in any one of the variables could lead to a high prob-
ability of rejection. In order that the discrete leapfrog integration be a reasonably

554

11. SAMPLING METHODS

good approximation to the true continuous-time dynamics, it is necessary for the
leapfrog integration scale  to be smaller than the shortest length-scale over which
the potential is varying signiﬁcantly. This is governed by the smallest value of σi,
which we denote by σmin. Recall that the goal of the leapfrog integration in hybrid
Monte Carlo is to move a substantial distance through phase space to a new state
that is relatively independent of the initial state and still achieve a high probability of
acceptance. In order to achieve this, the leapfrog integration must be continued for a
number of iterations of order σmax/σmin.

By contrast, consider the behaviour of a simple Metropolis algorithm with an
isotropic Gaussian proposal distribution of variance s2, considered earlier. In order
to avoid high rejection rates, the value of s must be of order σmin. The exploration of
state space then proceeds by a random walk and takes of order (σmax/σmin)2 steps
to arrive at a roughly independent state.

11.6. Estimating the Partition Function

As we have seen, most of the sampling algorithms considered in this chapter re-
quire only the functional form of the probability distribution up to a multiplicative
constant. Thus if we write

pE(z) =

exp(−E(z))

1
ZE

(11.71)

then the value of the normalization constant ZE, also known as the partition func-
tion, is not needed in order to draw samples from p(z). However, knowledge of the
value of ZE can be useful for Bayesian model comparison since it represents the
model evidence (i.e., the probability of the observed data given the model), and so
it is of interest to consider how its value might be obtained. We assume that direct
evaluation by summing, or integrating, the function exp(−E(z)) over the state space
of z is intractable.

For model comparison, it is actually the ratio of the partition functions for two
models that is required. Multiplication of this ratio by the ratio of prior probabilities
gives the ratio of posterior probabilities, which can then be used for model selection
or model averaging.

One way to estimate a ratio of partition functions is to use importance sampling

where {z(l)} are samples drawn from the distribution deﬁned by pG(z). If the dis-
tribution pG is one for which the partition function can be evaluated analytically, for
example a Gaussian, then the absolute value of ZE can be obtained.

This approach will only yield accurate results if the importance sampling distri-
bution pG is closely matched to the distribution pE, so that the ratio pE/pG does not
have wide variations. In practice, suitable analytically speciﬁed importance sampling
distributions cannot readily be found for the kinds of complex models considered in
this book.

An alternative approach is therefore to use the samples obtained from a Markov
chain to deﬁne the importance-sampling distribution. If the transition probability for
the Markov chain is given by T (z, z(cid:4)), and the sample set is given by z(1), . . . , z(L),
then the sampling distribution can be written as

L(cid:2)

l=1

exp (−G(z)) =

ZG

which can be used directly in (11.72).

T (z(l), z)

(11.73)

Methods for estimating the ratio of two partition functions require for their suc-
cess that the two corresponding distributions be reasonably closely matched. This is
especially problematic if we wish to ﬁnd the absolute value of the partition function
for a complex distribution because it is only for relatively simple distributions that
the partition function can be evaluated directly, and so attempting to estimate the
ratio of partition functions directly is unlikely to be successful. This problem can be
tackled using a technique known as chaining (Neal, 1993; Barber and Bishop, 1997),
which involves introducing a succession of intermediate distributions p2, . . . , pM−1
that interpolate between a simple distribution p1(z) for which we can evaluate the
normalization coefﬁcient Z1 and the desired complex distribution pM (z). We then
have

(11.74)

ZM
Z1

= Z2
Z1

Z3
Z2

··· ZM
ZM−1

in which the intermediate ratios can be determined using Monte Carlo methods as
discussed above. One way to construct such a sequence of intermediate systems
is to use an energy function containing a continuous parameter 0 (cid:1) α (cid:1) 1 that
interpolates between the two distributions

Eα(z) = (1 − α)E1(z) + αEM (z).

(11.75)

If the intermediate ratios in (11.74) are to be found using Monte Carlo, it may be
more efﬁcient to use a single Markov chain run than to restart the Markov chain for
each ratio. In this case, the Markov chain is run initially for the system p1 and then
after some suitable number of steps moves on to the next distribution in the sequence.
Note, however, that the system must remain close to the equilibrium distribution at
each stage.

Latent

Continuous

Variables

Appendix A

In Chapter 9, we discussed probabilistic models having discrete latent variables, such
as the mixture of Gaussians. We now explore models in which some, or all, of the
latent variables are continuous. An important motivation for such models is that
many data sets have the property that the data points all lie close to a manifold of
much lower dimensionality than that of the original data space. To see why this
might arise, consider an artiﬁcial data set constructed by taking one of the off-line
digits, represented by a 64 × 64 pixel grey-level image, and embedding it in a larger
image of size 100×100 by padding with pixels having the value zero (corresponding
to white pixels) in which the location and orientation of the digit is varied at random,
as illustrated in Figure 12.1. Each of the resulting images is represented by a point in
the 100× 100 = 10, 000-dimensional data space. However, across a data set of such
images, there are only three degrees of freedom of variability, corresponding to the
vertical and horizontal translations and the rotations. The data points will therefore
live on a subspace of the data space whose intrinsic dimensionality is three. Note

pixels.

that the manifold will be nonlinear because, for instance, if we translate the digit
past a particular pixel, that pixel value will go from zero (white) to one (black) and
back to zero again, which is clearly a nonlinear function of the digit position. In
this example, the translation and rotation parameters are latent variables because we
observe only the image vectors and are not told which values of the translation or
rotation variables were used to create them.

For real digit image data, there will be a further degree of freedom arising from
scaling. Moreover there will be multiple additional degrees of freedom associated
with more complex deformations due to the variability in an individual’s writing
as well as the differences in writing styles between individuals. Nevertheless, the
number of such degrees of freedom will be small compared to the dimensionality of
the data set.

Another example is provided by the oil ﬂow data set, in which (for a given ge-
ometrical conﬁguration of the gas, water, and oil phases) there are only two degrees
of freedom of variability corresponding to the fraction of oil in the pipe and the frac-
tion of water (the fraction of gas then being determined). Although the data space
comprises 12 measurements, a data set of points will lie close to a two-dimensional
manifold embedded within this space. In this case, the manifold comprises several
distinct segments corresponding to different ﬂow regimes, each such segment being
a (noisy) continuous two-dimensional manifold. If our goal is data compression, or
density modelling, then there can be beneﬁts in exploiting this manifold structure.

In practice, the data points will not be conﬁned precisely to a smooth low-
dimensional manifold, and we can interpret the departures of data points from the
manifold as ‘noise’. This leads naturally to a generative view of such models in
which we ﬁrst select a point within the manifold according to some latent variable
distribution and then generate an observed data point by adding noise, drawn from
some conditional distribution of the data variables given the latent variables.

The simplest continuous latent variable model assumes Gaussian distributions
for both the latent and observed variables and makes use of a linear-Gaussian de-
pendence of the observed variables on the state of the latent variables. This leads
to a probabilistic formulation of the well-known technique of principal component
analysis (PCA), as well as to a related model called factor analysis.

In this chapter w will begin with a standard, nonprobabilistic treatment of PCA,
and then we show how PCA arises naturally as the maximum likelihood solution to

a particular form of linear-Gaussian latent variable model. This probabilistic refor-
mulation brings many advantages, such as the use of EM for parameter estimation,
principled extensions to mixtures of PCA models, and Bayesian formulations that
allow the number of principal components to be determined automatically from the
data. Finally, we discuss brieﬂy several generalizations of the latent variable concept
that go beyond the linear-Gaussian assumption including non-Gaussian latent vari-
ables, which leads to the framework of independent component analysis, as well as
models having a nonlinear relationship between latent and observed variables.

12.1. Principal Component Analysis

Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a technique that is widely used for appli-
cations such as dimensionality reduction, lossy data compression, feature extraction,
and data visualization (Jolliffe, 2002). It is also known as the Karhunen-Lo`eve trans-
form.

There are two commonly used deﬁnitions of PCA that give rise to the same
algorithm. PCA can be deﬁned as the orthogonal projection of the data onto a lower
dimensional linear space, known as the principal subspace, such that the variance of
the projected data is maximized (Hotelling, 1933). Equivalently, it can be deﬁned as
the linear projection that minimizes the average projection cost, deﬁned as the mean
squared distance between the data points and their projections (Pearson, 1901). The
process of orthogonal projection is illustrated in Figure 12.2. We consider each of
these deﬁnitions in turn.

12.1.1 Maximum variance formulation
Consider a data set of observations {xn} where n = 1, . . . , N, and xn is a
Euclidean variable with dimensionality D. Our goal is to project the data onto a
space having dimensionality M < D while maximizing the variance of the projected
data. For the moment, we shall assume that the value of M is given. Later in this

562

12. CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES

chapter, we shall consider techniques to determine an appropriate value of M from
the data.

To begin with, consider the projection onto a one-dimensional space (M = 1).
We can deﬁne the direction of this space using a D-dimensional vector u1, which
for convenience (and without loss of generality) we shall choose to be a unit vector
1 u1 = 1 (note that we are only interested in the direction deﬁned by u1,
so that uT
not in the magnitude of u1 itself). Each data point xn is then projected onto a scalar
value uT

given by

and the variance of the projected data is given by

where S is the data covariance matrix deﬁned by

We now maximize the projected variance uT
1 Su1 with respect to u1. Clearly, this has
to be a constrained maximization to prevent (cid:5)u1(cid:5) → ∞. The appropriate constraint
1 u1 = 1. To enforce this constraint,
comes from the normalization condition uT
we introduce a Lagrange multiplier that we shall denote by λ1, and then make an
unconstrained maximization of

uT
1 Su1 + λ1

1 − uT

1 u1

.

(12.4)

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

By setting the derivative with respect to u1 equal to zero, we see that this quantity
will have a stationary point when

Su1 = λ1u1

(12.5)

which says that u1 must be an eigenvector of S. If we left-multiply by uT
use of uT

1 u1 = 1, we see that the variance is given by

1 and make

uT
1 Su1 = λ1

(12.6)

and so the variance will be a maximum when we set u1 equal to the eigenvector
having the largest eigenvalue λ1. This eigenvector is known as the ﬁrst principal
component.

We can deﬁne additional principal components in an incremental fashion by
choosing each new direction to be that which maximizes the projected variance

12.1. Principal Component Analysis

563

amongst all possible directions orthogonal to those already considered. If we con-
sider the general case of an M-dimensional projection space, the optimal linear pro-
jection for which the variance of the projected data is maximized is now deﬁned by
the M eigenvectors u1, . . . , uM of the data covariance matrix S corresponding to the
M largest eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λM . This is easily shown using proof by induction.

To summarize, principal component analysis involves evaluating the mean x
and the covariance matrix S of the data set and then ﬁnding the M eigenvectors of S
corresponding to the M largest eigenvalues. Algorithms for ﬁnding eigenvectors and
eigenvalues, as well as additional theorems related to eigenvector decomposition,
can be found in Golub and Van Loan (1996). Note that the computational cost of
computing the full eigenvector decomposition for a matrix of size D × D is O(D3).
If we plan to project our data onto the ﬁrst M principal components, then we only
need to ﬁnd the ﬁrst M eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This can be done with more
efﬁcient techniques, such as the power method (Golub and Van Loan, 1996), that
scale like O(M D2), or alternatively we can make use of the EM algorithm.

12.1.2 Minimum-error formulation
We now discuss an alternative formulation of PCA based on projection error
minimization. To do this, we introduce a complete orthonormal set of D-dimensional
basis vectors {ui} where i = 1, . . . , D that satisfy
uT
i uj = δij.

(12.7)

Exercise 12.1

Section 12.2.2

Appendix C

Because this basis is complete, each data point can be represented exactly by a linear
combination of the basis vectors

xn =

αniui

(12.8)

where the coefﬁcients αni will be different for different data points. This simply
corresponds to a rotation of the coordinate system to a new system deﬁned by the
{ui}, and the original D components {xn1, . . . , xnD} are replaced by an equivalent
set {αn1, . . . , αnD}. Taking the inner product with uj, and making use of the or-
thonormality property, we obtain αnj = xT
nuj, and so without loss of generality we
can write

xn =

xT
nui

ui.

(12.9)

Our goal, however, is to approximate this data point using a representation in-
volving a restricted number M < D of variables corresponding to a projection onto
a lower-dimensional subspace. The M-dimensional linear subspace can be repre-
sented, without loss of generality, by the ﬁrst M of the basis vectors, and so we
approximate each data point xn by

where the {zni} depend on the particular data point, whereas the {bi} are constants
that are the same for all data points. We are free to choose the {ui}, the {zni}, and
the {bi} so as to minimize the distortion introduced by the reduction in dimensional-
ity. As our distortion measure, we shall use the squared distance between the original

data point xn and its approximation(cid:4)xn, averaged over the data set, so that our goal

is to minimize

J =

Consider ﬁrst of all the minimization with respect to the quantities {zni}. Sub-

stituting for(cid:4)xn, setting the derivative with respect to znj to zero, and making use of

the orthonormality conditions, we obtain

znj = xT

nuj

(12.12)

where j = 1, . . . , M. Similarly, setting the derivative of J with respect to bi to zero,
and again making use of the orthonormality relations, gives

bj = xTuj

(12.13)

where j = M +1, . . . , D. If we substitute for zni and bi, and make use of the general

i = M + 1, . . . , D, as illustrated in Figure 12.2. This is to be expected because the

There remains the task of minimizing J with respect to the {ui}, which must
be a constrained minimization otherwise we will obtain the vacuous result ui = 0.
The constraints arise from the orthonormality conditions and, as we shall see, the
solution will be expressed in terms of the eigenvector expansion of the covariance
matrix. Before considering a formal solution, let us try to obtain some intuition about
the result by considering the case of a two-dimensional data space D = 2 and a one-
dimensional principal subspace M = 1. We have to choose a direction u2 so as to

Lagrange multiplier λ2 to enforce the constraint, we consider the minimization of

2 Su2, subject to the normalization constraint uT

2 u2 = 1. Using a

.

2 Su2 + λ2

(12.16)
Setting the derivative with respect to u2 to zero, we obtain Su2 = λ2u2 so that u2
is an eigenvector of S with eigenvalue λ2. Thus any eigenvector will deﬁne a sta-
tionary point of the distortion measure. To ﬁnd the value of J at the minimum, we
back-substitute the solution for u2 into the distortion measure to give J = λ2. We
therefore obtain the minimum value of J by choosing u2 to be the eigenvector corre-
sponding to the smaller of the two eigenvalues. Thus we should choose the principal
subspace to be aligned with the eigenvector having the larger eigenvalue. This result
accords with our intuition that, in order to minimize the average squared projection
distance, we should choose the principal component subspace to pass through the
mean of the data points and to be aligned with the directions of maximum variance.
For the case when the eigenvalues are equal, any choice of principal direction will
give rise to the same value of J.
The general solution to the minimization of J for arbitrary D and arbitrary M <
D is obtained by choosing the {ui} to be eigenvectors of the covariance matrix given
by
(12.17)
where i = 1, . . . , D, and as usual the eigenvectors {ui} are chosen to be orthonor-
mal. The corresponding value of the distortion measure is then given by

Sui = λiui

D(cid:2)

J =

λi

i=M +1

(12.18)

which is simply the sum of the eigenvalues of those eigenvectors that are orthogonal
to the principal subspace. We therefore obtain the minimum value of J by selecting
these eigenvectors to be those having the D − M smallest eigenvalues, and hence
the eigenvectors deﬁning the principal subspace are those corresponding to the M
largest eigenvalues.

Although we have considered M < D, the PCA analysis still holds if M =
D, in which case there is no dimensionality reduction but simply a rotation of the
coordinate axes to align with principal components.

Finally, it is worth noting that there exists a closely related linear dimensionality
reduction technique called canonical correlation analysis, or CCA (Hotelling, 1936;
Bach and Jordan, 2002). Whereas PCA works with a single random variable, CCA
considers two (or more) variables and tries to ﬁnd a corresponding pair of linear
subspaces that have high cross-correlation, so that each component within one of the
subspaces is correlated with a single component from the other subspace. Its solution
can be expressed in terms of a generalized eigenvector problem.

12.1.3 Applications of PCA
We can illustrate the use of PCA for data compression by considering the off-
line digits data set. Because each eigenvector of the covariance matrix is a vector

Another application of principal component analysis is to data pre-processing.
In this case, the goal is not dimensionality reduction but rather the transformation of
a data set in order to standardize certain of its properties. This can be important in
allowing subsequent pattern recognition algorithms to be applied successfully to the
data set. Typically, it is done when the original variables are measured in various dif-
ferent units or have signiﬁcantly different variability. For instance in the Old Faithful
data set, the time between eruptions is typically an order of magnitude greater than
the duration of an eruption. When we applied the K-means algorithm to this data
set, we ﬁrst made a separate linear re-scaling of the individual variables such that
each variable had zero mean and unit variance. This is known as standardizing the
data, and the covariance matrix for the standardized data has components

where σi is the variance of xi. This is known as the correlation matrix of the original
data and has the property that if two components xi and xj of the data are perfectly
correlated, then ρij = 1, and if they are uncorrelated, then ρij = 0.

However, using PCA we can make a more substantial normalization of the data
to give it zero mean and unit covariance, so that different variables become decorre-
lated. To do this, we ﬁrst write the eigenvector equation (12.17) in the form

SU = UL

This operation is known as whitening or sphereing the data and is illustrated for the
Old Faithful data set in Figure 12.6.

It is interesting to compare PCA with the Fisher linear discriminant which was
discussed in Section 4.1.4. Both methods can be viewed as techniques for linear
dimensionality reduction. However, PCA is unsupervised and depends only on the
values xn whereas Fisher linear discriminant also uses class-label information. This
difference is highlighted by the example in Figure 12.7.

Another common application of principal component analysis is to data visual-
ization. Here each data point is projected onto a two-dimensional (M = 2) principal
subspace, so that a data point xn is plotted at Cartesian coordinates given by xT
nu1
and xT
nu2, where u1 and u2 are the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest and
second largest eigenvalues. An example of such a plot, for the oil ﬂow data set, is
shown in Figure 12.8.

12.1.4 PCA for high-dimensional data
In some applications of principal component analysis, the number of data points
is smaller than the dimensionality of the data space. For example, we might want to
apply PCA to a data set of a few hundred images, each of which corresponds to a
vector in a space of potentially several million dimensions (corresponding to three
colour values for each of the pixels in the image). Note that in a D-dimensional space
a set of N points, where N < D, deﬁnes a linear subspace whose dimensionality
is at most N − 1, and so there is little point in applying PCA for values of M
that are greater than N − 1. Indeed, if we perform PCA we will ﬁnd that at least
D − N + 1 of the eigenvalues are zero, corresponding to eigenvectors along whose
directions the data set has zero variance. Furthermore, typical algorithms for ﬁnding
the eigenvectors of a D×D matrix have a computational cost that scales like O(D3),
and so for applications such as the image example, a direct application of PCA will
be computationally infeasible.
We can resolve this problem as follows. First, let us deﬁne X to be the (N ×D)-

570

12. CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES

dimensional centred data matrix, whose nth row is given by (xn − x)T. The covari-
−1XTX, and the corresponding
ance matrix (12.3) can then be written as S = N
eigenvector equation becomes

1
N

XTXui = λiui.

Now pre-multiply both sides by X to give

1
N

XXT(Xui) = λi(Xui).

If we now deﬁne vi = Xui, we obtain

(12.26)

(12.27)

XXTvi = λivi

(12.28)
which is an eigenvector equation for the N × N matrix N
−1XXT. We see that this
has the same N −1 eigenvalues as the original covariance matrix (which itself has an
additional D − N + 1 eigenvalues of value zero). Thus we can solve the eigenvector
problem in spaces of lower dimensionality with computational cost O(N 3) instead
of O(D3). In order to determine the eigenvectors, we multiply both sides of (12.28)
by XT to give

(cid:16)

XTX

(XTvi) = λi(XTvi)

(12.29)

1
N

(cid:15)

1
N

from which we see that (XTvi) is an eigenvector of S with eigenvalue λi. Note,
however, that these eigenvectors need not be normalized. To determine the appropri-
ate normalization, we re-scale ui ∝ XTvi by a constant such that (cid:5)ui(cid:5) = 1, which,
assuming vi has been normalized to unit length, gives

ui =

1

(N λi)1/2 XTvi.

(12.30)

In summary, to apply this approach we ﬁrst evaluate XXT and then ﬁnd its eigen-
vectors and eigenvalues and then compute the eigenvectors in the original data space
using (12.30).

12.2. Probabilistic PCA

The formulation of PCA discussed in the previous section was based on a linear
projection of the data onto a subspace of lower dimensionality than the original data
space. We now show that PCA can also be expressed as the maximum likelihood
solution of a probabilistic latent variable model. This reformulation of PCA, known
as probabilistic PCA, brings several advantages compared with conventional PCA:
• Probabilistic PCA represents a constrained form of the Gaussian distribution
in which the number of free parameters can be restricted while still allowing
the model to capture the dominant correlations in a data set.

12.2. Probabilistic PCA

571

• We can derive an EM algorithm for PCA that is computationally efﬁcient in
situations where only a few leading eigenvectors are required and that avoids
having to evaluate the data covariance matrix as an intermediate step.
• The combination of a probabilistic model and EM allows us to deal with miss-
ing values in the data set.
• Mixtures of probabilistic PCA models can be formulated in a principled way
and trained using the EM algorithm.
• Probabilistic PCA forms the basis for a Bayesian treatment of PCA in which
the dimensionality of the principal subspace can be found automatically from
the data.
• The existence of a likelihood function allows direct comparison with other
probabilistic density models. By contrast, conventional PCA will assign a low
reconstruction cost to data points that are close to the principal subspace even
if they lie arbitrarily far from the training data.
• Probabilistic PCA can be used to model class-conditional densities and hence
be applied to classiﬁcation problems.
• The probabilistic PCA model can be run generatively to provide samples from
the distribution.

This formulation of PCA as a probabilistic model was proposed independently by
Tipping and Bishop (1997, 1999b) and by Roweis (1998). As we shall see later, it is
closely related to factor analysis (Basilevsky, 1994).

Probabilistic PCA is a simple example of the linear-Gaussian framework, in
which all of the marginal and conditional distributions are Gaussian. We can formu-
late probabilistic PCA by ﬁrst introducing an explicit latent variable z corresponding
to the principal-component subspace. Next we deﬁne a Gaussian prior distribution
p(z) over the latent variable, together with a Gaussian conditional distribution p(x|z)
for the observed variable x conditioned on the value of the latent variable. Speciﬁ-
cally, the prior distribution over z is given by a zero-mean unit-covariance Gaussian

p(z) = N (z|0, I).

(12.31)

Similarly, the conditional distribution of the observed variable x, conditioned on the
value of the latent variable z, is again Gaussian, of the form

p(x|z) = N (x|Wz + µ, σ2I)

(12.32)
in which the mean of x is a general linear function of z governed by the D × M
matrix W and the D-dimensional vector µ. Note that this factorizes with respect to
the elements of x, in other words this is an example of the naive Bayes model. As
we shall see shortly, the columns of W span a linear subspace within the data space
that corresponds to the principal subspace. The other parameter in this model is the
scalar σ2 governing the variance of the conditional distribution. Note that there is no

distribution (illustrated by the red circles) having mean wbz + µ and covariance σ2I. The green ellipses show the
density contours for the marginal distribution p(x).

Exercise 12.4

loss of generality in assuming a zero mean, unit covariance Gaussian for the latent
distribution p(z) because a more general Gaussian distribution would give rise to an
equivalent probabilistic model.

We can view the probabilistic PCA model from a generative viewpoint in which
a sampled value of the observed variable is obtained by ﬁrst choosing a value for
the latent variable and then sampling the observed variable conditioned on this la-
tent value. Speciﬁcally, the D-dimensional observed variable x is deﬁned by a lin-
ear transformation of the M-dimensional latent variable z plus additive Gaussian
‘noise’, so that

x = Wz + µ + 

(12.33)
where z is an M-dimensional Gaussian latent variable, and  is a D-dimensional
zero-mean Gaussian-distributed noise variable with covariance σ2I. This generative
process is illustrated in Figure 12.9. Note that this framework is based on a mapping
from latent space to data space, in contrast to the more conventional view of PCA
discussed above. The reverse mapping, from data space to the latent space, will be
obtained shortly using Bayes’ theorem.

Suppose we wish to determine the values of the parameters W, µ and σ2 using
maximum likelihood. To write down the likelihood function, we need an expression
for the marginal distribution p(x) of the observed variable. This is expressed, from
the sum and product rules of probability, in the form

(cid:6)

p(x) =

p(x|z)p(z) dz.

(12.34)

Exercise 12.7

Because this corresponds to a linear-Gaussian model, this marginal distribution is
again Gaussian, and is given by

p(x) = N (x|µ, C)

(12.35)

(12.37)

where the D × D covariance matrix C is deﬁned by

Intuitively, we can think of the distribution p(x) as being deﬁned by taking an
isotropic Gaussian ‘spray can’ and moving it across the principal subspace spraying

The accumulated ink density gives rise to a ‘pancake’ shaped distribution represent-
ing the marginal density p(x).

The predictive distribution p(x) is governed by the parameters µ, W, and σ2.
However, there is redundancy in this parameterization corresponding to rotations of

the latent space coordinates. To see this, consider a matrix,W = WR where R is
quantity,W,WT that appears in the covariance matrix C takes the form
and hence is independent of R. Thus there is a whole family of matrices,W all of

,W,WT = WRRTWT = WWT

(12.39)

which give rise to the same predictive distribution. This invariance can be understood
in terms of rotations within the latent space. We shall return to a discussion of the
number of independent parameters in this model later.
When we evaluate the predictive distribution, we require C−1, which involves
the inversion of a D× D matrix. The computation required to do this can be reduced
by making use of the matrix inversion identity (C.7) to give
−2WM−1WT

−1I − σ
where the M × M matrix M is deﬁned by

C−1 = σ

(12.40)

Exercise 12.8

M = WTW + σ2I.

(12.41)
Because we invert M rather than inverting C directly, the cost of evaluating C−1 is
reduced from O(D3) to O(M 3).
As well as the predictive distribution p(x), we will also require the posterior
distribution p(z|x), which can again be written down directly using the result (2.116)
for linear-Gaussian models to give

12.2.1 Maximum likelihood PCA
We next consider the determination of the model parameters using maximum
likelihood. Given a data set X = {xn} of observed data points, the probabilistic
PCA model can be expressed as a directed graph, as shown in Figure 12.10. The
corresponding log likelihood function is given, from (12.35), by

Setting the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to µ equal to zero gives the
expected result µ = x where x is the data mean deﬁned by (12.1). Back-substituting
we can then write the log likelihood function in the form

(cid:10)

where S is the data covariance matrix deﬁned by (12.3). Because the log likelihood
is a quadratic function of µ, this solution represents the unique maximum, as can be
conﬁrmed by computing second derivatives.

Maximization with respect to W and σ2 is more complex but nonetheless has
an exact closed-form solution. It was shown by Tipping and Bishop (1999b) that all
of the stationary points of the log likelihood function can be written as

WML = UM (LM − σ2I)1/2R

(12.45)
where UM is a D × M matrix whose columns are given by any subset (of size M)
of the eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix S, the M × M diagonal matrix
LM has elements given by the corresponding eigenvalues λi, and R is an arbitrary
M × M orthogonal matrix.

Furthermore, Tipping and Bishop (1999b) showed that the maximum of the like-
lihood function is obtained when the M eigenvectors are chosen to be those whose
eigenvalues are the M largest (all other solutions being saddle points). A similar re-
sult was conjectured independently by Roweis (1998), although no proof was given.

12.2. Probabilistic PCA

575

Again, we shall assume that the eigenvectors have been arranged in order of decreas-
ing values of the corresponding eigenvalues, so that the M principal eigenvectors are
u1, . . . , uM . In this case, the columns of W deﬁne the principal subspace of stan-
dard PCA. The corresponding maximum likelihood solution for σ2 is then given by

D(cid:2)

so that σ2

ML is the average variance associated with the discarded dimensions.

Because R is orthogonal, it can be interpreted as a rotation matrix in the M ×M
latent space. If we substitute the solution for W into the expression for C, and make
use of the orthogonality property RRT = I, we see that C is independent of R.
This simply says that the predictive density is unchanged by rotations in the latent
space as discussed earlier. For the particular case of R = I, we see that the columns
of W are the principal component eigenvectors scaled by the variance parameters
λi − σ2. The interpretation of these scaling factors is clear once we recognize that
for a convolution of independent Gaussian distributions (in this case the latent space
distribution and the noise model) the variances are additive. Thus the variance λi
in the direction of an eigenvector ui is composed of the sum of a contribution λi −
σ2 from the projection of the unit-variance latent space distribution into data space
through the corresponding column of W, plus an isotropic contribution of variance
σ2 which is added in all directions by the noise model.

It is worth taking a moment to study the form of the covariance matrix given
by (12.36). Consider the variance of the predictive distribution along some direction
speciﬁed by the unit vector v, where vTv = 1, which is given by vTCv. First
suppose that v is orthogonal to the principal subspace, in other words it is given by
some linear combination of the discarded eigenvectors. Then vTU = 0 and hence
vTCv = σ2. Thus the model predicts a noise variance orthogonal to the principal
subspace, which, from (12.46), is just the average of the discarded eigenvalues. Now
suppose that v = ui where ui is one of the retained eigenvectors deﬁning the prin-
cipal subspace. Then vTCv = (λi − σ2) + σ2 = λi. In other words, this model
correctly captures the variance of the data along the principal axes, and approximates
the variance in all remaining directions with a single average value σ2.

One way to construct the maximum likelihood density model would simply be
to ﬁnd the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix and then to
evaluate W and σ2 using the results given above. In this case, we would choose
R = I for convenience. However, if the maximum likelihood solution is found by
numerical optimization of the likelihood function, for instance using an algorithm
such as conjugate gradients (Fletcher, 1987; Nocedal and Wright, 1999; Bishop and
Nabney, 2008) or through the EM algorithm, then the resulting value of R is es-
sentially arbitrary. This implies that the columns of W need not be orthogonal. If
an orthogonal basis is required, the matrix W can be post-processed appropriately
(Golub and Van Loan, 1996). Alternatively, the EM algorithm can be modiﬁed in
such a way as to yield orthonormal principal directions, sorted in descending order
of the corresponding eigenvalues, directly (Ahn and Oh, 2003).

Section 12.2.2

576

12. CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES

The rotational invariance in latent space represents a form of statistical noniden-
tiﬁability, analogous to that encountered for mixture models in the case of discrete
latent variables. Here there is a continuum of parameters all of which lead to the
same predictive density, in contrast to the discrete nonidentiﬁability associated with
component re-labelling in the mixture setting.

If we consider the case of M = D, so that there is no reduction of dimension-
ality, then UM = U and LM = L. Making use of the orthogonality properties
UUT = I and RRT = I, we see that the covariance C of the marginal distribution
for x becomes

C = U(L − σ2I)1/2RRT(L − σ2I)1/2UT + σ2I = ULUT = S

(12.47)

and so we obtain the standard maximum likelihood solution for an unconstrained
Gaussian distribution in which the covariance matrix is given by the sample covari-
ance.

Conventional PCA is generally formulated as a projection of points from the D-
dimensional data space onto an M-dimensional linear subspace. Probabilistic PCA,
however, is most naturally expressed as a mapping from the latent space into the data
space via (12.33). For applications such as visualization and data compression, we
can reverse this mapping using Bayes’ theorem. Any point x in data space can then
be summarized by its posterior mean and covariance in latent space. From (12.42)
the mean is given by

E[z|x] = M−1WT

ML(x − x)

where M is given by (12.41). This projects to a point in data space given by

WE[z|x] + µ.

(12.48)

(12.49)

Section 3.3.1

Note that this takes the same form as the equations for regularized linear regression
and is a consequence of maximizing the likelihood function for a linear Gaussian
model. Similarly, the posterior covariance is given from (12.42) by σ2M−1 and is
independent of x.

If we take the limit σ2 → 0, then the posterior mean reduces to

Section 2.3

which represents an orthogonal projection of the data point onto the latent space,
and so we recover the standard PCA model. The posterior covariance in this limit is
zero, however, and the density becomes singular. For σ2 > 0, the latent projection
is shifted towards the origin, relative to the orthogonal projection.

Finally, we note that an important role for the probabilistic PCA model is in
deﬁning a multivariate Gaussian distribution in which the number of degrees of free-
dom, in other words the number of independent parameters, can be controlled whilst
still allowing the model to capture the dominant correlations in the data. Recall
that a general Gaussian distribution has D(D + 1)/2 independent parameters in its
covariance matrix (plus another D parameters in its mean). Thus the number of
parameters scales quadratically with D and can become excessive in spaces of high

12.2. Probabilistic PCA

577

dimensionality. If we restrict the covariance matrix to be diagonal, then it has only D
independent parameters, and so the number of parameters now grows linearly with
dimensionality. However, it now treats the variables as if they were independent and
hence can no longer express any correlations between them. Probabilistic PCA pro-
vides an elegant compromise in which the M most signiﬁcant correlations can be
captured while still ensuring that the total number of parameters grows only linearly
with D. We can see this by evaluating the number of degrees of freedom in the
PPCA model as follows. The covariance matrix C depends on the parameters W,
which has size D× M, and σ2, giving a total parameter count of DM +1. However,
we have seen that there is some redundancy in this parameterization associated with
rotations of the coordinate system in the latent space. The orthogonal matrix R that
expresses these rotations has size M × M. In the ﬁrst column of this matrix there are
M − 1 independent parameters, because the column vector must be normalized to
unit length. In the second column there are M − 2 independent parameters, because
the column must be normalized and also must be orthogonal to the previous column,
and so on. Summing this arithmetic series, we see that R has a total of M(M −1)/2
independent parameters. Thus the number of degrees of freedom in the covariance
matrix C is given by

(12.51)
The number of independent parameters in this model therefore only grows linearly
with D, for ﬁxed M. If we take M = D − 1, then we recover the standard result
for a full covariance Gaussian. In this case, the variance along D − 1 linearly in-
dependent directions is controlled by the columns of W, and the variance along the
remaining direction is given by σ2. If M = 0, the model is equivalent to the isotropic
covariance case.

DM + 1 − M(M − 1)/2.

12.2.2 EM algorithm for PCA
As we have seen, the probabilistic PCA model can be expressed in terms of a
marginalization over a continuous latent space z in which for each data point xn,
there is a corresponding latent variable zn. We can therefore make use of the EM
algorithm to ﬁnd maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters. This may
seem rather pointless because we have already obtained an exact closed-form so-
lution for the maximum likelihood parameter values. However, in spaces of high
dimensionality, there may be computational advantages in using an iterative EM
procedure rather than working directly with the sample covariance matrix. This EM
procedure can also be extended to the factor analysis model, for which there is no
closed-form solution. Finally, it allows missing data to be handled in a principled
way.

We can derive the EM algorithm for probabilistic PCA by following the general
framework for EM. Thus we write down the complete-data log likelihood and take
its expectation with respect to the posterior distribution of the latent distribution
evaluated using ‘old’ parameter values. Maximization of this expected complete-
data log likelihood then yields the ‘new’ parameter values. Because the data points

where the nth row of the matrix Z is given by zn. We already know that the exact
maximum likelihood solution for µ is given by the sample mean x deﬁned by (12.1),
and it is convenient to substitute for µ at this stage. Making use of the expressions
(12.31) and (12.32) for the latent and conditional distributions, respectively, and tak-

The EM algorithm for probabilistic PCA proceeds by initializing the parameters
and then alternately computing the sufﬁcient statistics of the latent space posterior
distribution using (12.54) and (12.55) in the E step and revising the parameter values
using (12.56) and (12.57) in the M step.

One of the beneﬁts of the EM algorithm for PCA is computational efﬁciency
for large-scale applications (Roweis, 1998). Unlike conventional PCA based on an

12.2. Probabilistic PCA

579

eigenvector decomposition of the sample covariance matrix, the EM approach is
iterative and so might appear to be less attractive. However, each cycle of the EM
algorithm can be computationally much more efﬁcient than conventional PCA in
spaces of high dimensionality. To see this, we note that the eigendecomposition of
the covariance matrix requires O(D3) computation. Often we are interested only
in the ﬁrst M eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues, in which case we
can use algorithms that are O(M D2). However, the evaluation of the covariance
matrix itself takes O(N D2) computations, where N is the number of data points.
Algorithms such as the snapshot method (Sirovich, 1987), which assume that the
eigenvectors are linear combinations of the data vectors, avoid direct evaluation of
the covariance matrix but are O(N 3) and hence unsuited to large data sets. The EM
algorithm described here also does not construct the covariance matrix explicitly.
Instead, the most computationally demanding steps are those involving sums over
the data set that are O(N DM). For large D, and M (cid:13) D, this can be a signiﬁcant
saving compared to O(N D2) and can offset the iterative nature of the EM algorithm.
Note that this EM algorithm can be implemented in an on-line form in which
each D-dimensional data point is read in and processed and then discarded before
the next data point is considered. To see this, note that the quantities evaluated in
the E step (an M-dimensional vector and an M × M matrix) can be computed for
each data point separately, and in the M step we need to accumulate sums over data
points, which we can do incrementally. This approach can be advantageous if both
N and D are large.

Because we now have a fully probabilistic model for PCA, we can deal with
missing data, provided that it is missing at random, by marginalizing over the dis-
tribution of the unobserved variables. Again these missing values can be treated
using the EM algorithm. We give an example of the use of this approach for data
visualization in Figure 12.11.
Another elegant feature of the EM approach is that we can take the limit σ2 → 0,
corresponding to standard PCA, and still obtain a valid EM-like algorithm (Roweis,
1998). From (12.55), we see that the only quantity we need to compute in the E step
is E[zn]. Furthermore, the M step is simpliﬁed because M = WTW. To emphasize
nth row is given by the vector xn − x and similarly deﬁne Ω to be a matrix of size
D × M whose nth row is given by the vector E[zn]. The E step (12.54) of the EM
algorithm for PCA then becomes

the simplicity of the algorithm, let us deﬁne (cid:4)X to be a matrix of size N × D whose

(12.58)

(12.59)

Again these can be implemented in an on-line form. These equations have a simple
interpretation as follows. From our earlier discussion, we see that the E step involves
an orthogonal projection of the data points onto the current estimate for the principal
subspace. Correspondingly, the M step represents a re-estimation of the principal

left-hand plot shows the posterior mean projections of the data points on the principal subspace. The right-hand
plot is obtained by ﬁrst randomly omitting 30% of the variable values and then using EM to handle the missing
values. Note that each data point then has at least one missing measurement but that the plot is very similar to
the one obtained without missing values.

Exercise 12.17

subspace to minimize the squared reconstruction error in which the projections are
ﬁxed.

We can give a simple physical analogy for this EM algorithm, which is easily
visualized for D = 2 and M = 1. Consider a collection of data points in two
dimensions, and let the one-dimensional principal subspace be represented by a solid
rod. Now attach each data point to the rod via a spring obeying Hooke’s law (stored
energy is proportional to the square of the spring’s length). In the E step, we keep
the rod ﬁxed and allow the attachment points to slide up and down the rod so as to
minimize the energy. This causes each attachment point (independently) to position
itself at the orthogonal projection of the corresponding data point onto the rod. In
the M step, we keep the attachment points ﬁxed and then release the rod and allow it
to move to the minimum energy position. The E and M steps are then repeated until
a suitable convergence criterion is satisﬁed, as is illustrated in Figure 12.12.

12.2.3 Bayesian PCA
So far in our discussion of PCA, we have assumed that the value M for the
dimensionality of the principal subspace is given. In practice, we must choose a
suitable value according to the application. For visualization, we generally choose
M = 2, whereas for other applications the appropriate choice for M may be less
clear. One approach is to plot the eigenvalue spectrum for the data set, analogous
to the example in Figure 12.4 for the off-line digits data set, and look to see if the
eigenvalues naturally form two groups comprising a set of small values separated by
a signiﬁcant gap from a set of relatively large values, indicating a natural choice for
M. In practice, such a gap is often not seen.

Section 1.3

Because the probabilistic PCA model has a well-deﬁned likelihood function, we
could employ cross-validation to determine the value of dimensionality by selecting
the largest log likelihood on a validation data set. Such an approach, however, can
become computationally costly, particularly if we consider a probabilistic mixture
of PCA models (Tipping and Bishop, 1999a) in which we seek to determine the
appropriate dimensionality separately for each component in the mixture.

Given that we have a probabilistic formulation of PCA, it seems natural to seek
a Bayesian approach to model selection. To do this, we need to marginalize out
the model parameters µ, W, and σ2 with respect to appropriate prior distributions.
This can be done by using a variational framework to approximate the analytically
intractable marginalizations (Bishop, 1999b). The marginal likelihood values, given
by the variational lower bound, can then be compared for a range of different values
of M and the value giving the largest marginal likelihood selected.

Here we consider a simpler approach introduced by based on the evidence ap-

proximation, which is appropriate when the number of data points is relatively large
and the corresponding posterior distribution is tightly peaked (Bishop, 1999a). It
involves a speciﬁc choice of prior over W that allows surplus dimensions in the
principal subspace to be pruned out of the model. This corresponds to an example of
automatic relevance determination, or ARD, discussed in Section 7.2.2. Speciﬁcally,
we deﬁne an independent Gaussian prior over each column of W, which represent
the vectors deﬁning the principal subspace. Each such Gaussian has an independent
variance governed by a precision hyperparameter αi so that

(12.60)

where wi is the ith column of W. The resulting model can be represented using the
directed graph shown in Figure 12.13.

The values for αi will be found iteratively by maximizing the marginal likeli-
hood function in which W has been integrated out. As a result of this optimization,
some of the αi may be driven to inﬁnity, with the corresponding parameters vec-
tor wi being driven to zero (the posterior distribution becomes a delta function at
the origin) giving a sparse solution. The effective dimensionality of the principal
subspace is then determined by the number of ﬁnite αi values, and the correspond-
ing vectors wi can be thought of as ‘relevant’ for modelling the data distribution.
In this way, the Bayesian approach is automatically making the trade-off between
improving the ﬁt to the data, by using a larger number of vectors wi with their cor-
responding eigenvalues λi each tuned to the data, and reducing the complexity of
the model by suppressing some of the wi vectors. The origins of this sparsity were
discussed earlier in the context of relevance vector machines.

The values of αi are re-estimated during training by maximizing the log marginal

likelihood given by

p(X|α, µ, σ2) =

p(X|W, µ, σ2)p(W|α) dW

(12.61)
where the log of p(X|W, µ, σ2) is given by (12.43). Note that for simplicity we also
treat µ and σ2 as parameters to be estimated, rather than deﬁning priors over these
parameters.

Because this integration is intractable, we make use of the Laplace approxima-
tion. If we assume that the posterior distribution is sharply peaked, as will occur for
sufﬁciently large data sets, then the re-estimation equations obtained by maximizing
the marginal likelihood with respect to αi take the simple form

i = D
αnew
i wi
wT

(12.62)

which follows from (3.98), noting that the dimensionality of wi is D. These re-
estimations are interleaved with the EM algorithm updates for determining W and
σ2. The E-step equations are again given by (12.54) and (12.55). Similarly, the M-
step equation for σ2 is again given by (12.57). The only change is to the M-step
equation for W, which is modiﬁed to give

where A = diag(αi). The value of µ is given by the sample mean, as before.

If we choose M = D − 1 then, if all αi values are ﬁnite, the model represents
a full-covariance Gaussian, while if all the αi go to inﬁnity the model is equivalent
to an isotropic Gaussian, and so the model can encompass all permissible values for
the effective dimensionality of the principal subspace. It is also possible to consider
smaller values of M, which will save on computational cost but which will limit
the maximum dimensionality of the subspace. A comparison of the results of this
algorithm with standard probabilistic PCA is shown in Figure 12.14.

Bayesian PCA provides an opportunity to illustrate the Gibbs sampling algo-
rithm discussed in Section 11.3. Figure 12.15 shows an example of the samples
from the hyperparameters ln αi for a data set in D = 4 dimensions in which the di-
mensionality of the latent space is M = 3 but in which the data set is generated from
a probabilistic PCA model having one direction of high variance, with the remaining
directions comprising low variance noise. This result shows clearly the presence of
three distinct modes in the posterior distribution. At each step of the iteration, one of
the hyperparameters has a small value and the remaining two have large values, so
that two of the three latent variables are suppressed. During the course of the Gibbs
sampling, the solution makes sharp transitions between the three modes.

The model described here involves a prior only over the matrix W. A fully
Bayesian treatment of PCA, including priors over µ, σ2, and α, and solved us-
ing variational methods, is described in Bishop (1999b). For a discussion of vari-
ous Bayesian approaches to determining the appropriate dimensionality for a PCA
model, see Minka (2001c).

12.2.4 Factor analysis
Factor analysis is a linear-Gaussian latent variable model that is closely related
to probabilistic PCA. Its deﬁnition differs from that of probabilistic PCA only in that
the conditional distribution of the observed variable x given the latent variable z is

a square (white for positive and black for negative values) whose area is proportional
to the magnitude of that element. The synthetic data set comprises 300 data points in
D = 10 dimensions sampled from a Gaussian distribution having standard deviation 1.0
in 3 directions and standard deviation 0.5 in the remaining 7 directions for a data set in
D = 10 dimensions having M = 3 directions with larger variance than the remaining 7
directions. The left-hand plot shows the result from maximum likelihood probabilistic PCA,
and the left-hand plot shows the corresponding result from Bayesian PCA. We see how
the Bayesian model is able to discover the appropriate dimensionality by suppressing the
6 surplus degrees of freedom.

taken to have a diagonal rather than an isotropic covariance so that

p(x|z) = N (x|Wz + µ, Ψ)

(12.64)
where Ψ is a D×D diagonal matrix. Note that the factor analysis model, in common
with probabilistic PCA, assumes that the observed variables x1, . . . , xD are indepen-
dent, given the latent variable z. In essence, the factor analysis model is explaining
the observed covariance structure of the data by representing the independent vari-
ance associated with each coordinate in the matrix Ψ and capturing the covariance
between variables in the matrix W. In the factor analysis literature, the columns
of W, which capture the correlations between observed variables, are called factor
loadings, and the diagonal elements of Ψ, which represent the independent noise
variances for each of the variables, are called uniquenesses.

The origins of factor analysis are as old as those of PCA, and discussions of
factor analysis can be found in the books by Everitt (1984), Bartholomew (1987),
and Basilevsky (1994). Links between factor analysis and PCA were investigated
by Lawley (1953) and Anderson (1963) who showed that at stationary points of
the likelihood function, for a factor analysis model with Ψ = σ2I, the columns of
W are scaled eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix, and σ2 is the average
of the discarded eigenvalues. Later, Tipping and Bishop (1999b) showed that the
maximum of the log likelihood function occurs when the eigenvectors comprising
W are chosen to be the principal eigenvectors.

Making use of (2.115), we see that the marginal distribution for the observed

C = WWT + Ψ.

(12.65)

As with probabilistic PCA, this model is invariant to rotations in the latent space.

Historically, factor analysis has been the subject of controversy when attempts
have been made to place an interpretation on the individual factors (the coordinates
in z-space), which has proven problematic due to the nonidentiﬁability of factor
analysis associated with rotations in this space. From our perspective, however, we
shall view factor analysis as a form of latent variable density model, in which the
form of the latent space is of interest but not the particular choice of coordinates
used to describe it. If we wish to remove the degeneracy associated with latent space
rotations, we must consider non-Gaussian latent variable distributions, giving rise to
independent component analysis (ICA) models.

We can determine the parameters µ, W, and Ψ in the factor analysis model by
maximum likelihood. The solution for µ is again given by the sample mean. How-
ever, unlike probabilistic PCA, there is no longer a closed-form maximum likelihood
solution for W, which must therefore be found iteratively. Because factor analysis is
a latent variable model, this can be done using an EM algorithm (Rubin and Thayer,
1982) that is analogous to the one used for probabilistic PCA. Speciﬁcally, the E-step
equations are given by

E[zn] = GWTΨ

where the ‘diag’ operator sets all of the nondiagonal elements of a matrix to zero. A
Bayesian treatment of the factor analysis model can be obtained by a straightforward
application of the techniques discussed in this book.

Another difference between probabilistic PCA and factor analysis concerns their
different behaviour under transformations of the data set. For PCA and probabilis-
tic PCA, if we rotate the coordinate system in data space, then we obtain exactly
the same ﬁt to the data but with the W matrix transformed by the corresponding
rotation matrix. However, for factor analysis, the analogous property is that if we
make a component-wise re-scaling of the data vectors, then this is absorbed into a
corresponding re-scaling of the elements of Ψ.

12.3. Kernel PCA

In Chapter 6, we saw how the technique of kernel substitution allows us to take an
algorithm expressed in terms of scalar products of the form xTx(cid:4)
and generalize
that algorithm by replacing the scalar products with a nonlinear kernel. Here we
apply this technique of kernel substitution to principal component analysis, thereby
obtaining a nonlinear generalization called kernel PCA (Sch¨olkopf et al., 1998).
Consider a data set {xn} of observations, where n = 1, . . . , N, in a space of
(cid:5)
dimensionality D. In order to keep the notation uncluttered, we shall assume that
we have already subtracted the sample mean from each of the vectors xn, so that
n xn = 0. The ﬁrst step is to express conventional PCA in such a form that the
data vectors {xn} appear only in the form of the scalar products xT
nxm. Recall that
the principal components are deﬁned by the eigenvectors ui of the covariance matrix

where i = 1, . . . , D. Here the D × D sample covariance matrix S is deﬁned by

Sui = λiui

and the eigenvectors are normalized such that uT

Now consider a nonlinear transformation φ(x) into an M-dimensional feature
space, so that each data point xn is thereby projected onto a point φ(xn). We can

vector v1. The green lines in feature space indicate the linear projections onto the ﬁrst principal component,
which correspond to nonlinear projections in the original data space. Note that in general it is not possible to
represent the nonlinear principal component by a vector in x space.

(cid:5)
now perform standard PCA in the feature space, which implicitly deﬁnes a nonlinear
principal component model in the original data space, as illustrated in Figure 12.16.
For the moment, let us assume that the projected data set also has zero mean,
n φ(xn) = 0. We shall return to this point shortly. The M × M sample

tells us that vi satisﬁes

Cvi = λivi

φ(xn)Tvi

(12.75)

We can ﬁnd solutions for ai by solving the following eigenvalue problem

Kai = λiNai

(12.80)

in which we have removed a factor of K from both sides of (12.79). Note that
the solutions of (12.79) and (12.80) differ only by eigenvectors of K having zero
eigenvalues that do not affect the principal components projection.

The normalization condition for the coefﬁcients ai is obtained by requiring that
the eigenvectors in feature space be normalized. Using (12.76) and (12.80), we have

In the original D-dimensional x space there are D orthogonal eigenvectors and
hence we can ﬁnd at most D linear principal components. The dimensionality M
of the feature space, however, can be much larger than D (even inﬁnite), and thus
we can ﬁnd a number of nonlinear principal components that can exceed D. Note,
however, that the number of nonzero eigenvalues cannot exceed the number N of
data points, because (even if M > N) the covariance matrix in feature space has
rank at most equal to N. This is reﬂected in the fact that kernel PCA involves the
eigenvector expansion of the N × N matrix K.

So far we have assumed that the projected data set given by φ(xn) has zero
mean, which in general will not be the case. We cannot simply compute and then
subtract off the mean, since we wish to avoid working directly in feature space, and
so again, we formulate the algorithm purely in terms of the kernel function. The

projected data points after centralizing, denoted(cid:4)φ(xn), are given by

Thus we can evaluate (cid:4)K using only the kernel function and then use (cid:4)K to determine

the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Note that the standard PCA algorithm is recovered
as a special case if we use a linear kernel k(x, x(cid:4)) = xTx(cid:4)

One obvious disadvantage of kernel PCA is that it involves ﬁnding the eigenvec-

tors of the N × N matrix (cid:4)K rather than the D × D matrix S of conventional linear
(cid:1)xn onto the L-dimensional principal subspace, deﬁned by

PCA, and so in practice for large data sets approximations are often used.

In kernel PCA, this will in general not be possible. To see this, note that the map-
ping φ(x) maps the D-dimensional x space into a D-dimensional manifold in the
M-dimensional feature space φ. The vector x is known as the pre-image of the
corresponding point φ(x). However, the projection of points in feature space onto
the linear PCA subspace in that space will typically not lie on the nonlinear D-
dimensional manifold and so will not have a corresponding pre-image in data space.
Techniques have therefore been proposed for ﬁnding approximate pre-images (Bakir
et al., 2004).

12.4. Nonlinear Latent Variable Models

In this chapter, we have focussed on the simplest class of models having continuous
latent variables, namely those based on linear-Gaussian distributions. As well as
having great practical importance, these models are relatively easy to analyse and
to ﬁt to data and can also be used as components in more complex models. Here
we consider brieﬂy some generalizations of this framework to models that are either
nonlinear or non-Gaussian, or both.

In fact, the issues of nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity are related because a
general probability density can be obtained from a simple ﬁxed reference density,
such as a Gaussian, by making a nonlinear change of variables. This idea forms the
basis of several practical latent variable models as we shall see shortly.

Exercise 12.28

12.4.1 Independent component analysis
We begin by considering models in which the observed variables are related
linearly to the latent variables, but for which the latent distribution is non-Gaussian.
An important class of such models, known as independent component analysis, or
ICA, arises when we consider a distribution over the latent variables that factorizes,
so that

M(cid:14)

p(z) =

p(zj).

(12.89)

j=1

To understand the role of such models, consider a situation in which two people
are talking at the same time, and we record their voices using two microphones.
If we ignore effects such as time delay and echoes, then the signals received by
the microphones at any point in time will be given by linear combinations of the
amplitudes of the two voices. The coefﬁcients of this linear combination will be
constant, and if we can infer their values from sample data, then we can invert the
mixing process (assuming it is nonsingular) and thereby obtain two clean signals
each of which contains the voice of just one person. This is an example of a problem
called blind source separation in which ‘blind’ refers to the fact that we are given
only the mixed data, and neither the original sources nor the mixing coefﬁcients are
observed (Cardoso, 1998).

This type of problem is sometimes addressed using the following approach
(MacKay, 2003) in which we ignore the temporal nature of the signals and treat the
successive samples as i.i.d. We consider a generative model in which there are two
latent variables corresponding to the unobserved speech signal amplitudes, and there
are two observed variables given by the signal values at the microphones. The latent
variables have a joint distribution that factorizes as above, and the observed variables
are given by a linear combination of the latent variables. There is no need to include
a noise distribution because the number of latent variables equals the number of ob-
served variables, and therefore the marginal distribution of the observed variables
will not in general be singular, so the observed variables are simply deterministic
linear combinations of the latent variables. Given a data set of observations, the

592

12. CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES

Exercise 12.29

likelihood function for this model is a function of the coefﬁcients in the linear com-
bination. The log likelihood can be maximized using gradient-based optimization
giving rise to a particular version of independent component analysis.

The success of this approach requires that the latent variables have non-Gaussian
distributions. To see this, recall that in probabilistic PCA (and in factor analysis) the
latent-space distribution is given by a zero-mean isotropic Gaussian. The model
therefore cannot distinguish between two different choices for the latent variables
where these differ simply by a rotation in latent space. This can be veriﬁed directly
by noting that the marginal density (12.35), and hence the likelihood function, is
unchanged if we make the transformation W → WR where R is an orthogonal
matrix satisfying RRT = I, because the matrix C given by (12.36) is itself invariant.
Extending the model to allow more general Gaussian latent distributions does not
change this conclusion because, as we have seen, such a model is equivalent to the
zero-mean isotropic Gaussian latent variable model.

Another way to see why a Gaussian latent variable distribution in a linear model
is insufﬁcient to ﬁnd independent components is to note that the principal compo-
nents represent a rotation of the coordinate system in data space such as to diagonal-
ize the covariance matrix, so that the data distribution in the new coordinates is then
uncorrelated. Although zero correlation is a necessary condition for independence
it is not, however, sufﬁcient. In practice, a common choice for the latent-variable
distribution is given by

p(zj) =

1

π cosh(zj)

=

1

π(ezj + e−zj )

(12.90)

which has heavy tails compared to a Gaussian, reﬂecting the observation that many
real-world distributions also exhibit this property.

The original ICA model (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) was based on the optimiza-
tion of an objective function deﬁned by information maximization. One advantage
of a probabilistic latent variable formulation is that it helps to motivate and formu-
late generalizations of basic ICA. For instance, independent factor analysis (Attias,
1999a) considers a model in which the number of latent and observed variables can
differ, the observed variables are noisy, and the individual latent variables have ﬂex-
ible distributions modelled by mixtures of Gaussians. The log likelihood for this
model is maximized using EM, and the reconstruction of the latent variables is ap-
proximated using a variational approach. Many other types of model have been
considered, and there is now a huge literature on ICA and its applications (Jutten
and Herault, 1991; Comon et al., 1991; Amari et al., 1996; Pearlmutter and Parra,
1997; Hyv¨arinen and Oja, 1997; Hinton et al., 2001; Miskin and MacKay, 2001;
Hojen-Sorensen et al., 2002; Choudrey and Roberts, 2003; Chan et al., 2003; Stone,
2004).

12.4.2 Autoassociative neural networks
In Chapter 5 we considered neural networks in the context of supervised learn-
ing, where the role of the network is to predict the output variables given values

12.4. Nonlinear Latent Variable Models

two layers of weights. Such a network is trained to
map input vectors onto themselves by minimiza-
tion of a sum-of-squares error. Even with non-
linear units in the hidden layer, such a network
is equivalent to linear principal component anal-
ysis. Links representing bias parameters have
been omitted for clarity.

for the input variables. However, neural networks have also been applied to un-
supervised learning where they have been used for dimensionality reduction. This
is achieved by using a network having the same number of outputs as inputs, and
optimizing the weights so as to minimize some measure of the reconstruction error
between inputs and outputs with respect to a set of training data.

Consider ﬁrst a multilayer perceptron of the form shown in Figure 12.18, hav-
ing D inputs, D output units and M hidden units, with M < D. The targets used
to train the network are simply the input vectors themselves, so that the network
is attempting to map each input vector onto itself. Such a network is said to form
an autoassociative mapping. Since the number of hidden units is smaller than the
number of inputs, a perfect reconstruction of all input vectors is not in general pos-
sible. We therefore determine the network parameters w by minimizing an error
function which captures the degree of mismatch between the input vectors and their
reconstructions. In particular, we shall choose a sum-of-squares error of the form

N(cid:2)

n=1

E(w) =

1
2

(cid:5)y(xn, w) − xn(cid:5)2.

(12.91)

If the hidden units have linear activations functions, then it can be shown that the
error function has a unique global minimum, and that at this minimum the network
performs a projection onto the M-dimensional subspace which is spanned by the ﬁrst
M principal components of the data (Bourlard and Kamp, 1988; Baldi and Hornik,
1989). Thus, the vectors of weights which lead into the hidden units in Figure 12.18
form a basis set which spans the principal subspace. Note, however, that these vec-
tors need not be orthogonal or normalized. This result is unsurprising, since both
principal component analysis and the neural network are using linear dimensionality
reduction and are minimizing the same sum-of-squares error function.

It might be thought that the limitations of a linear dimensionality reduction could
be overcome by using nonlinear (sigmoidal) activation functions for the hidden units
in the network in Figure 12.18. However, even with nonlinear hidden units, the min-
imum error solution is again given by the projection onto the principal component
subspace (Bourlard and Kamp, 1988). There is therefore no advantage in using two-
layer neural networks to perform dimensionality reduction. Standard techniques for
principal component analysis (based on singular value decomposition) are guaran-
teed to give the correct solution in ﬁnite time, and they also generate an ordered set
of eigenvalues with corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors.

The situation is different, however, if additional hidden layers are permitted in
the network. Consider the four-layer autoassociative network shown in Figure 12.19.
Again the output units are linear, and the M units in the second hidden layer can also
be linear, however, the ﬁrst and third hidden layers have sigmoidal nonlinear activa-
tion functions. The network is again trained by minimization of the error function
(12.91). We can view this network as two successive functional mappings F1 and
F2, as indicated in Figure 12.19. The ﬁrst mapping F1 projects the original D-
dimensional data onto an M-dimensional subspace S deﬁned by the activations of
the units in the second hidden layer. Because of the presence of the ﬁrst hidden layer
of nonlinear units, this mapping is very general, and in particular is not restricted to
being linear. Similarly, the second half of the network deﬁnes an arbitrary functional
mapping from the M-dimensional space back into the original D-dimensional input
space. This has a simple geometrical interpretation, as indicated for the case D = 3
and M = 2 in Figure 12.20.

Such a network effectively performs a nonlinear principal component analysis.

space S into a D-dimensional space and therefore deﬁnes the way in which the space S is embedded within the
original x-space. Since the mapping F2 can be nonlinear, the embedding of S can be nonplanar, as indicated
in the ﬁgure. The mapping F1 then deﬁnes a projection of points in the original D-dimensional space into the
M-dimensional subspace S.

12.4. Nonlinear Latent Variable Models

595

It has the advantage of not being limited to linear transformations, although it con-
tains standard principal component analysis as a special case. However, training
the network now involves a nonlinear optimization problem, since the error function
(12.91) is no longer a quadratic function of the network parameters. Computation-
ally intensive nonlinear optimization techniques must be used, and there is the risk of
ﬁnding a suboptimal local minimum of the error function. Also, the dimensionality
of the subspace must be speciﬁed before training the network.

12.4.3 Modelling nonlinear manifolds
As we have already noted, many natural sources of data correspond to low-
dimensional, possibly noisy, nonlinear manifolds embedded within the higher di-
mensional observed data space. Capturing this property explicitly can lead to im-
proved density modelling compared with more general methods. Here we consider
brieﬂy a range of techniques that attempt to do this.

One way to model the nonlinear structure is through a combination of linear
models, so that we make a piece-wise linear approximation to the manifold. This can
be obtained, for instance, by using a clustering technique such as K-means based on
Euclidean distance to partition the data set into local groups with standard PCA ap-
plied to each group. A better approach is to use the reconstruction error for cluster
assignment (Kambhatla and Leen, 1997; Hinton et al., 1997) as then a common cost
function is being optimized in each stage. However, these approaches still suffer
from limitations due to the absence of an overall density model. By using prob-
abilistic PCA it is straightforward to deﬁne a fully probabilistic model simply by
considering a mixture distribution in which the components are probabilistic PCA
models (Tipping and Bishop, 1999a). Such a model has both discrete latent vari-
ables, corresponding to the discrete mixture, as well as continuous latent variables,
and the likelihood function can be maximized using the EM algorithm. A fully
Bayesian treatment, based on variational inference (Bishop and Winn, 2000), allows
the number of components in the mixture, as well as the effective dimensionalities
of the individual models, to be inferred from the data. There are many variants of
this model in which parameters such as the W matrix or the noise variances are tied
across components in the mixture, or in which the isotropic noise distributions are
replaced by diagonal ones, giving rise to a mixture of factor analysers (Ghahramani
and Hinton, 1996a; Ghahramani and Beal, 2000). The mixture of probabilistic PCA
models can also be extended hierarchically to produce an interactive data visualiza-
tion algorithm (Bishop and Tipping, 1998).

An alternative to considering a mixture of linear models is to consider a single
nonlinear model. Recall that conventional PCA ﬁnds a linear subspace that passes
close to the data in a least-squares sense. This concept can be extended to one-
dimensional nonlinear surfaces in the form of principal curves (Hastie and Stuetzle,
1989). We can describe a curve in a D-dimensional data space using a vector-valued
function f(λ), which is a vector each of whose elements is a function of the scalar λ.
There are many possible ways to parameterize the curve, of which a natural choice

is the arc length along the curve. For any given point(cid:1)x in data space, we can ﬁnd

the point on the curve that is closest in Euclidean distance. We denote this point by

596

12. CONTINUOUS LATENT VARIABLES

λ = gf (x) because it depends on the particular curve f(λ). For a continuous data
density p(x), a principal curve is deﬁned as one for which every point on the curve
is the mean of all those points in data space that project to it, so that

E [x|gf (x) = λ] = f(λ).

(12.92)

For a given continuous density, there can be many principal curves. In practice, we
are interested in ﬁnite data sets, and we also wish to restrict attention to smooth
curves. Hastie and Stuetzle (1989) propose a two-stage iterative procedure for ﬁnd-
ing such principal curves, somewhat reminiscent of the EM algorithm for PCA. The
curve is initialized using the ﬁrst principal component, and then the algorithm alter-
nates between a data projection step and curve re-estimation step. In the projection
step, each data point is assigned to a value of λ corresponding to the closest point
on the curve. Then in the re-estimation step, each point on the curve is given by
a weighted average of those points that project to nearby points on the curve, with
points closest on the curve given the greatest weight. In the case where the subspace
is constrained to be linear, the procedure converges to the ﬁrst principal component
and is equivalent to the power method for ﬁnding the largest eigenvector of the co-
variance matrix. Principal curves can be generalized to multidimensional manifolds
called principal surfaces although these have found limited use due to the difﬁculty
of data smoothing in higher dimensions even for two-dimensional manifolds.

PCA is often used to project a data set onto a lower-dimensional space, for ex-
ample two dimensional, for the purposes of visualization. Another linear technique
with a similar aim is multidimensional scaling, or MDS (Cox and Cox, 2000). It ﬁnds
a low-dimensional projection of the data such as to preserve, as closely as possible,
the pairwise distances between data points, and involves ﬁnding the eigenvectors of
the distance matrix. In the case where the distances are Euclidean, it gives equivalent
results to PCA. The MDS concept can be extended to a wide variety of data types
speciﬁed in terms of a similarity matrix, giving nonmetric MDS.

Two other nonprobabilistic methods for dimensionality reduction and data vi-
sualization are worthy of mention. Locally linear embedding, or LLE (Roweis and
Saul, 2000) ﬁrst computes the set of coefﬁcients that best reconstructs each data
point from its neighbours. These coefﬁcients are arranged to be invariant to rota-
tions, translations, and scalings of that data point and its neighbours, and hence they
characterize the local geometrical properties of the neighbourhood. LLE then maps
the high-dimensional data points down to a lower dimensional space while preserv-
ing these neighbourhood coefﬁcients.
If the local neighbourhood for a particular
data point can be considered linear, then the transformation can be achieved using
a combination of translation, rotation, and scaling, such as to preserve the angles
formed between the data points and their neighbours. Because the weights are in-
variant to these transformations, we expect the same weight values to reconstruct the
data points in the low-dimensional space as in the high-dimensional data space. In
spite of the nonlinearity, the optimization for LLE does not exhibit local minima.

In isometric feature mapping, or isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), the goal is
to project the data to a lower-dimensional space using MDS, but where the dissim-
ilarities are deﬁned in terms of the geodesic distances measured along the mani-

12.4. Nonlinear Latent Variable Models

597

fold. For instance, if two points lie on a circle, then the geodesic is the arc-length
distance measured around the circumference of the circle not the straight line dis-
tance measured along the chord connecting them. The algorithm ﬁrst deﬁnes the
neighbourhood for each data point, either by ﬁnding the K nearest neighbours or by
ﬁnding all points within a sphere of radius . A graph is then constructed by link-
ing all neighbouring points and labelling them with their Euclidean distance. The
geodesic distance between any pair of points is then approximated by the sum of
the arc lengths along the shortest path connecting them (which itself is found using
standard algorithms). Finally, metric MDS is applied to the geodesic distance matrix
to ﬁnd the low-dimensional projection.

Our focus in this chapter has been on models for which the observed vari-
ables are continuous. We can also consider models having continuous latent vari-
ables together with discrete observed variables, giving rise to latent trait models
(Bartholomew, 1987). In this case, the marginalization over the continuous latent
variables, even for a linear relationship between latent and observed variables, can-
not be performed analytically, and so more sophisticated techniques are required.
Tipping (1999) uses variational inference in a model with a two-dimensional latent
space, allowing a binary data set to be visualized analogously to the use of PCA to
visualize continuous data. Note that this model is the dual of the Bayesian logistic
regression problem discussed in Section 4.5. In the case of logistic regression we
have N observations of the feature vector φn which are parameterized by a single
parameter vector w, whereas in the latent space visualization model there is a single
latent space variable x (analogous to φ) and N copies of the latent variable wn. A
generalization of probabilistic latent variable models to general exponential family
distributions is described in Collins et al. (2002).

We have already noted that an arbitrary distribution can be formed by taking a
Gaussian random variable and transforming it through a suitable nonlinearity. This
is exploited in a general latent variable model called a density network (MacKay,
1995; MacKay and Gibbs, 1999) in which the nonlinear function is governed by a
multilayered neural network. If the network has enough hidden units, it can approx-
imate a given nonlinear function to any desired accuracy. The downside of having
such a ﬂexible model is that the marginalization over the latent variables, required in
order to obtain the likelihood function, is no longer analytically tractable. Instead,
the likelihood is approximated using Monte Carlo techniques by drawing samples
from the Gaussian prior. The marginalization over the latent variables then becomes
a simple sum with one term for each sample. However, because a large number
of sample points may be required in order to give an accurate representation of the
marginal, this procedure can be computationally costly.

If we consider more restricted forms for the nonlinear function, and make an ap-
propriate choice of the latent variable distribution, then we can construct a latent vari-
able model that is both nonlinear and efﬁcient to train. The generative topographic
mapping, or GTM (Bishop et al., 1996; Bishop et al., 1997a; Bishop et al., 1998b)
uses a latent distribution that is deﬁned by a ﬁnite regular grid of delta functions over
the (typically two-dimensional) latent space. Marginalization over the latent space
then simply involves summing over the contributions from each of the grid locations.

model, each data point is plotted at the mean of its posterior distribution in latent space. The nonlinearity of the
GTM model allows the separation between the groups of data points to be seen more clearly.

Chapter 3

Section 1.4

The nonlinear mapping is given by a linear regression model that allows for general
nonlinearity while being a linear function of the adaptive parameters. Note that the
usual limitation of linear regression models arising from the curse of dimensionality
does not arise in the context of the GTM since the manifold generally has two dimen-
sions irrespective of the dimensionality of the data space. A consequence of these
two choices is that the likelihood function can be expressed analytically in closed
form and can be optimized efﬁciently using the EM algorithm. The resulting GTM
model ﬁts a two-dimensional nonlinear manifold to the data set, and by evaluating
the posterior distribution over latent space for the data points, they can be projected
back to the latent space for visualization purposes. Figure 12.21 shows a comparison
of the oil data set visualized with linear PCA and with the nonlinear GTM.

The GTM can be seen as a probabilistic version of an earlier model called the self
organizing map, or SOM (Kohonen, 1982; Kohonen, 1995), which also represents
a two-dimensional nonlinear manifold as a regular array of discrete points. The
SOM is somewhat reminiscent of the K-means algorithm in that data points are
assigned to nearby prototype vectors that are then subsequently updated. Initially,
the prototypes are distributed at random, and during the training process they ‘self
organize’ so as to approximate a smooth manifold. Unlike K-means, however, the
SOM is not optimizing any well-deﬁned cost function (Erwin et al., 1992) making it
difﬁcult to set the parameters of the model and to assess convergence. There is also
no guarantee that the ‘self-organization’ will take place as this is dependent on the
choice of appropriate parameter values for any particular data set.

By contrast, GTM optimizes the log likelihood function, and the resulting model
deﬁnes a probability density in data space. In fact, it corresponds to a constrained
mixture of Gaussians in which the components share a common variance, and the
means are constrained to lie on a smooth two-dimensional manifold. This proba-

bilistic foundation also makes it very straightforward to deﬁne generalizations of
GTM (Bishop et al., 1998a) such as a Bayesian treatment, dealing with missing val-
ues, a principled extension to discrete variables, the use of Gaussian processes to
deﬁne the manifold, or a hierarchical GTM model (Tino and Nabney, 2002).

Because the manifold in GTM is deﬁned as a continuous surface, not just at the
prototype vectors as in the SOM, it is possible to compute the magniﬁcation factors
corresponding to the local expansions and compressions of the manifold needed to
ﬁt the data set (Bishop et al., 1997b) as well as the directional curvatures of the
manifold (Tino et al., 2001). These can be visualized along with the projected data
and provide additional insight into the model.

12.1 ((cid:12) (cid:12)) www In this exercise, we use proof by induction to show that the linear
projection onto an M-dimensional subspace that maximizes the variance of the pro-
jected data is deﬁned by the M eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix S, given
by (12.3), corresponding to the M largest eigenvalues. In Section 12.1, this result
was proven for the case of M = 1. Now suppose the result holds for some general
value of M and show that it consequently holds for dimensionality M + 1. To do
this, ﬁrst set the derivative of the variance of the projected data with respect to a
vector uM +1 deﬁning the new direction in data space equal to zero. This should
be done subject to the constraints that uM +1 be orthogonal to the existing vectors
u1, . . . , uM , and also that it be normalized to unit length. Use Lagrange multipli-
ers to enforce these constraints. Then make use of the orthonormality properties of
the vectors u1, . . . , uM to show that the new vector uM +1 is an eigenvector of S.
Finally, show that the variance is maximized if the eigenvector is chosen to be the
one corresponding to eigenvector λM +1 where the eigenvalues have been ordered in
decreasing value.

Show that the minimum value of the PCA distortion measure J given by
(12.15) with respect to the ui, subject to the orthonormality constraints (12.7), is
obtained when the ui are eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix S. To do this,
introduce a matrix H of Lagrange multipliers, one for each constraint, so that the

where (cid:1)U is a matrix of dimension D × (D − M) whose columns are given by ui.

Sequential

Data

So far in this book, we have focussed primarily on sets of data points that were as-
sumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption allowed
us to express the likelihood function as the product over all data points of the prob-
ability distribution evaluated at each data point. For many applications, however,
the i.i.d. assumption will be a poor one. Here we consider a particularly important
class of such data sets, namely those that describe sequential data. These often arise
through measurement of time series, for example the rainfall measurements on suc-
cessive days at a particular location, or the daily values of a currency exchange rate,
or the acoustic features at successive time frames used for speech recognition. An
example involving speech data is shown in Figure 13.1. Sequential data can also
arise in contexts other than time series, for example the sequence of nucleotide base
pairs along a strand of DNA or the sequence of characters in an English sentence.
For convenience, we shall sometimes refer to ‘past’ and ‘future’ observations in a
sequence. However, the models explored in this chapter are equally applicable to all

forms of sequential data, not just temporal sequences.

It is useful to distinguish between stationary and nonstationary sequential dis-
tributions. In the stationary case, the data evolves in time, but the distribution from
which it is generated remains the same. For the more complex nonstationary situa-
tion, the generative distribution itself is evolving with time. Here we shall focus on
the stationary case.

For many applications, such as ﬁnancial forecasting, we wish to be able to pre-
dict the next value in a time series given observations of the previous values. In-
tuitively, we expect that recent observations are likely to be more informative than
more historical observations in predicting future values. The example in Figure 13.1
shows that successive observations of the speech spectrum are indeed highly cor-
related. Furthermore, it would be impractical to consider a general dependence of
future observations on all previous observations because the complexity of such a
model would grow without limit as the number of observations increases. This leads
us to consider Markov models in which we assume that future predictions are inde-

pendent of all but the most recent observations.

Although such models are tractable, they are also severely limited. We can ob-
tain a more general framework, while still retaining tractability, by the introduction
of latent variables, leading to state space models. As in Chapters 9 and 12, we shall
see that complex models can thereby be constructed from simpler components (in
particular, from distributions belonging to the exponential family) and can be read-
ily characterized using the framework of probabilistic graphical models. Here we
focus on the two most important examples of state space models, namely the hid-
den Markov model, in which the latent variables are discrete, and linear dynamical
systems, in which the latent variables are Gaussian. Both models are described by di-
rected graphs having a tree structure (no loops) for which inference can be performed
efﬁciently using the sum-product algorithm.

13.1. Markov Models

The easiest way to treat sequential data would be simply to ignore the sequential
aspects and treat the observations as i.i.d., corresponding to the graph in Figure 13.2.
Such an approach, however, would fail to exploit the sequential patterns in the data,
such as correlations between observations that are close in the sequence. Suppose,
for instance, that we observe a binary variable denoting whether on a particular day
it rained or not. Given a time series of recent observations of this variable, we wish
to predict whether it will rain on the next day. If we treat the data as i.i.d., then the
only information we can glean from the data is the relative frequency of rainy days.
However, we know in practice that the weather often exhibits trends that may last for
several days. Observing whether or not it rains today is therefore of signiﬁcant help
in predicting if it will rain tomorrow.

To express such effects in a probabilistic model, we need to relax the i.i.d. as-
sumption, and one of the simplest ways to do this is to consider a Markov model.
First of all we note that, without loss of generality, we can use the product rule to
express the joint distribution for a sequence of observations in the form

N(cid:14)

p(x1, . . . , xN ) =

p(xn|x1, . . . , xn−1).

(13.1)

n=1

If we now assume that each of the conditional distributions on the right-hand side
is independent of all previous observations except the most recent, we obtain the
ﬁrst-order Markov chain, which is depicted as a graphical model in Figure 13.3. The

From the d-separation property, we see that the conditional distribution for observa-
tion xn, given all of the observations up to time n, is given by
p(xn|x1, . . . , xn−1) = p(xn|xn−1)

(13.3)

which is easily veriﬁed by direct evaluation starting from (13.2) and using the prod-
uct rule of probability. Thus if we use such a model to predict the next observation
in a sequence, the distribution of predictions will depend only on the value of the im-
mediately preceding observation and will be independent of all earlier observations.
In most applications of such models, the conditional distributions p(xn|xn−1)
that deﬁne the model will be constrained to be equal, corresponding to the assump-
tion of a stationary time series. The model is then known as a homogeneous Markov
chain. For instance, if the conditional distributions depend on adjustable parameters
(whose values might be inferred from a set of training data), then all of the condi-
tional distributions in the chain will share the same values of those parameters.

N(cid:14)

N(cid:14)

Although this is more general than the independence model, it is still very re-
strictive. For many sequential observations, we anticipate that the trends in the data
over several successive observations will provide important information in predict-
ing the next value. One way to allow earlier observations to have an inﬂuence is to
move to higher-order Markov chains. If we allow the predictions to depend also on
the previous-but-one value, we obtain a second-order Markov chain, represented by
the graph in Figure 13.4. The joint distribution is now given by

p(x1, . . . , xN ) = p(x1)p(x2|x1)

p(xn|xn−1, xn−2).

(13.4)

Again, using d-separation or by direct evaluation, we see that the conditional distri-
bution of xn given xn−1 and xn−2 is independent of all observations x1, . . . xn−3.

Each observation is now inﬂuenced by two previous observations. We can similarly
consider extensions to an M th order Markov chain in which the conditional distri-
bution for a particular variable depends on the previous M variables. However, we
have paid a price for this increased ﬂexibility because the number of parameters in
the model is now much larger. Suppose the observations are discrete variables hav-
ing K states. Then the conditional distribution p(xn|xn−1) in a ﬁrst-order Markov
chain will be speciﬁed by a set of K − 1 parameters for each of the K states of xn−1
giving a total of K(K − 1) parameters. Now suppose we extend the model to an
M th order Markov chain, so that the joint distribution is built up from conditionals
p(xn|xn−M , . . . , xn−1). If the variables are discrete, and if the conditional distri-
butions are represented by general conditional probability tables, then the number
of parameters in such a model will have KM−1(K − 1) parameters. Because this
grows exponentially with M, it will often render this approach impractical for larger
values of M.

For continuous variables, we can use linear-Gaussian conditional distributions
in which each node has a Gaussian distribution whose mean is a linear function
of its parents. This is known as an autoregressive or AR model (Box et al., 1994;
Thiesson et al., 2004). An alternative approach is to use a parametric model for
p(xn|xn−M , . . . , xn−1) such as a neural network. This technique is sometimes
called a tapped delay line because it corresponds to storing (delaying) the previous
M values of the observed variable in order to predict the next value. The number
of parameters can then be much smaller than in a completely general model (for ex-
ample it may grow linearly with M), although this is achieved at the expense of a
restricted family of conditional distributions.

Suppose we wish to build a model for sequences that is not limited by the
Markov assumption to any order and yet that can be speciﬁed using a limited number
of free parameters. We can achieve this by introducing additional latent variables to
permit a rich class of models to be constructed out of simple components, as we did
with mixture distributions in Chapter 9 and with continuous latent variable models in
Chapter 12. For each observation xn, we introduce a corresponding latent variable
zn (which may be of different type or dimensionality to the observed variable). We
now assume that it is the latent variables that form a Markov chain, giving rise to the
graphical structure known as a state space model, which is shown in Figure 13.5. It
satisﬁes the key conditional independence property that zn−1 and zn+1 are indepen-
dent given zn, so that

zn+1 ⊥⊥ zn−1 | zn.

Using the d-separation criterion, we see that there is always a path connecting any
two observed variables xn and xm via the latent variables, and that this path is never
blocked. Thus the predictive distribution p(xn+1|x1, . . . , xn) for observation xn+1
given all previous observations does not exhibit any conditional independence prop-
erties, and so our predictions for xn+1 depends on all previous observations. The
observed variables, however, do not satisfy the Markov property at any order. We
shall discuss how to evaluate the predictive distribution in later sections of this chap-
ter.

There are two important models for sequential data that are described by this
graph. If the latent variables are discrete, then we obtain the hidden Markov model,
or HMM (Elliott et al., 1995). Note that the observed variables in an HMM may
be discrete or continuous, and a variety of different conditional distributions can be
used to model them. If both the latent and the observed variables are Gaussian (with
a linear-Gaussian dependence of the conditional distributions on their parents), then
we obtain the linear dynamical system.

Section 13.2

Section 13.3

13.2. Hidden Markov Models

The hidden Markov model can be viewed as a speciﬁc instance of the state space
model of Figure 13.5 in which the latent variables are discrete. However, if we
examine a single time slice of the model, we see that it corresponds to a mixture
distribution, with component densities given by p(x|z).
It can therefore also be
interpreted as an extension of a mixture model in which the choice of mixture com-
ponent for each observation is not selected independently but depends on the choice
of component for the previous observation. The HMM is widely used in speech
recognition (Jelinek, 1997; Rabiner and Juang, 1993), natural language modelling
(Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999), on-line handwriting recognition (Nag et al., 1986),
and for the analysis of biological sequences such as proteins and DNA (Krogh et al.,
1994; Durbin et al., 1998; Baldi and Brunak, 2001).

As in the case of a standard mixture model, the latent variables are the discrete
multinomial variables zn describing which component of the mixture is responsible
for generating the corresponding observation xn. Again, it is convenient to use a
1-of-K coding scheme, as used for mixture models in Chapter 9. We now allow the
probability distribution of zn to depend on the state of the previous latent variable
zn−1 through a conditional distribution p(zn|zn−1). Because the latent variables are
K-dimensional binary variables, this conditional distribution corresponds to a table
of numbers that we denote by A, the elements of which are known as transition
probabilities. They are given by Ajk ≡ p(znk = 1|zn−1,j = 1), and because they
are probabilities, they satisfy 0 (cid:1) Ajk (cid:1) 1 with
k Ajk = 1, so that the matrix A

The transition matrix is sometimes illustrated diagrammatically by drawing the
states as nodes in a state transition diagram as shown in Figure 13.6 for the case of
K = 3. Note that this does not represent a probabilistic graphical model, because
the nodes are not separate variables but rather states of a single variable, and so we
have shown the states as boxes rather than circles.

Section 8.4.5

It is sometimes useful to take a state transition diagram, of the kind shown in
Figure 13.6, and unfold it over time. This gives an alternative representation of the
transitions between latent states, known as a lattice or trellis diagram, and which is
shown for the case of the hidden Markov model in Figure 13.7.
The speciﬁcation of the probabilistic model is completed by deﬁning the con-
ditional distributions of the observed variables p(xn|zn, φ), where φ is a set of pa-
rameters governing the distribution. These are known as emission probabilities, and
might for example be given by Gaussians of the form (9.11) if the elements of x are
continuous variables, or by conditional probability tables if x is discrete. Because
xn is observed, the distribution p(xn|zn, φ) consists, for a given value of φ, of a
vector of K numbers corresponding to the K possible states of the binary vector zn.

We shall focuss attention on homogeneous models for which all of the condi-
tional distributions governing the latent variables share the same parameters A, and
similarly all of the emission distributions share the same parameters φ (the extension
to more general cases is straightforward). Note that a mixture model for an i.i.d. data
set corresponds to the special case in which the parameters Ajk are the same for all
values of j, so that the conditional distribution p(zn|zn−1) is independent of zn−1.
This corresponds to deleting the horizontal links in the graphical model shown in
Figure 13.5.

where X = {x1, . . . , xN}, Z = {z1, . . . , zN}, and θ = {π, A, φ} denotes the set
of parameters governing the model. Most of our discussion of the hidden Markov
model will be independent of the particular choice of the emission probabilities.
Indeed, the model is tractable for a wide range of emission distributions including
discrete tables, Gaussians, and mixtures of Gaussians. It is also possible to exploit
discriminative models such as neural networks. These can be used to model the
emission density p(x|z) directly, or to provide a representation for p(z|x) that can
be converted into the required emission density p(x|z) using Bayes’ theorem (Bishop
et al., 2004).

We can gain a better understanding of the hidden Markov model by considering
it from a generative point of view. Recall that to generate samples from a mixture of

Figure 13.8 Illustration of sampling from a hidden Markov model having a 3-state latent variable z and a
Gaussian emission model p(x|z) where x is 2-dimensional. (a) Contours of constant probability density for the
emission distributions corresponding to each of the three states of the latent variable. (b) A sample of 50 points
drawn from the hidden Markov model, colour coded according to the component that generated them and with
lines connecting the successive observations. Here the transition matrix was ﬁxed so that in any state there is a
5% probability of making a transition to each of the other states, and consequently a 90% probability of remaining
in the same state.

Gaussians, we ﬁrst chose one of the components at random with probability given by
the mixing coefﬁcients πk and then generate a sample vector x from the correspond-
ing Gaussian component. This process is repeated N times to generate a data set of
N independent samples. In the case of the hidden Markov model, this procedure is
modiﬁed as follows. We ﬁrst choose the initial latent variable z1 with probabilities
governed by the parameters πk and then sample the corresponding observation x1.
Now we choose the state of the variable z2 according to the transition probabilities
p(z2|z1) using the already instantiated value of z1. Thus suppose that the sample for
z1 corresponds to state j. Then we choose the state k of z2 with probabilities Ajk
for k = 1, . . . , K. Once we know z2 we can draw a sample for x2 and also sample
the next latent variable z3 and so on. This is an example of ancestral sampling for
a directed graphical model. If, for instance, we have a model in which the diago-
nal transition elements Akk are much larger than the off-diagonal elements, then a
typical data sequence will have long runs of points generated from a single compo-
nent, with infrequent transitions from one component to another. The generation of
samples from a hidden Markov model is illustrated in Figure 13.8.

There are many variants of the standard HMM model, obtained for instance by
imposing constraints on the form of the transition matrix A (Rabiner, 1989). Here we
mention one of particular practical importance called the left-to-right HMM, which
is obtained by setting the elements Ajk of A to zero if k < j, as illustrated in the

Section 8.1.2

state transition diagram for a 3-state HMM in Figure 13.9. Typically for such models
the initial state probabilities for p(z1) are modiﬁed so that p(z11) = 1 and p(z1j) = 0
for j (cid:9)= 1, in other words every sequence is constrained to start in state j = 1. The
transition matrix may be further constrained to ensure that large changes in the state
index do not occur, so that Ajk = 0 if k > j + ∆. This type of model is illustrated
using a lattice diagram in Figure 13.10.

Many applications of hidden Markov models, for example speech recognition,
or on-line character recognition, make use of left-to-right architectures. As an illus-
tration of the left-to-right hidden Markov model, we consider an example involving
handwritten digits. This uses on-line data, meaning that each digit is represented
by the trajectory of the pen as a function of time in the form of a sequence of pen
coordinates, in contrast to the off-line digits data, discussed in Appendix A, which
comprises static two-dimensional pixellated images of the ink. Examples of the on-
line digits are shown in Figure 13.11. Here we train a hidden Markov model on a
subset of data comprising 45 examples of the digit ‘2’. There are K = 16 states,
each of which can generate a line segment of ﬁxed length having one of 16 possible
angles, and so the emission distribution is simply a 16 × 16 table of probabilities
associated with the allowed angle values for each state index value. Transition prob-
abilities are all set to zero except for those that keep the state index k the same or
that increment it by 1, and the model parameters are optimized using 25 iterations of
EM. We can gain some insight into the resulting model by running it generatively, as
shown in Figure 13.11.

Figure 13.11 Top row: examples of on-line handwritten
digits. Bottom row: synthetic digits sam-
pled generatively from a left-to-right hid-
den Markov model that has been trained
on a data set of 45 handwritten digits.

One of the most powerful properties of hidden Markov models is their ability to
exhibit some degree of invariance to local warping (compression and stretching) of
the time axis. To understand this, consider the way in which the digit ‘2’ is written
in the on-line handwritten digits example. A typical digit comprises two distinct
sections joined at a cusp. The ﬁrst part of the digit, which starts at the top left, has a
sweeping arc down to the cusp or loop at the bottom left, followed by a second more-
or-less straight sweep ending at the bottom right. Natural variations in writing style
will cause the relative sizes of the two sections to vary, and hence the location of the
cusp or loop within the temporal sequence will vary. From a generative perspective
such variations can be accommodated by the hidden Markov model through changes
in the number of transitions to the same state versus the number of transitions to the
successive state. Note, however, that if a digit ‘2’ is written in the reverse order, that
is, starting at the bottom right and ending at the top left, then even though the pen tip
coordinates may be identical to an example from the training set, the probability of
the observations under the model will be extremely small. In the speech recognition
context, warping of the time axis is associated with natural variations in the speed of
speech, and again the hidden Markov model can accommodate such a distortion and
not penalize it too heavily.

13.2.1 Maximum likelihood for the HMM
If we have observed a data set X = {x1, . . . , xN}, we can determine the param-
eters of an HMM using maximum likelihood. The likelihood function is obtained
from the joint distribution (13.10) by marginalizing over the latent variables

(cid:2)

p(X|θ) =

p(X, Z|θ).

(13.11)

Z

Because the joint distribution p(X, Z|θ) does not factorize over n (in contrast to the
mixture distribution considered in Chapter 9), we cannot simply treat each of the
summations over zn independently. Nor can we perform the summations explicitly
because there are N variables to be summed over, each of which has K states, re-
sulting in a total of K N terms. Thus the number of terms in the summation grows

616

13. SEQUENTIAL DATA

exponentially with the length of the chain. In fact, the summation in (13.11) cor-
responds to summing over exponentially many paths through the lattice diagram in
Figure 13.7.

We have already encountered a similar difﬁculty when we considered the infer-
ence problem for the simple chain of variables in Figure 8.32. There we were able
to make use of the conditional independence properties of the graph to re-order the
summations in order to obtain an algorithm whose cost scales linearly, instead of
exponentially, with the length of the chain. We shall apply a similar technique to the
hidden Markov model.

A further difﬁculty with the expression (13.11) for the likelihood function is that,
because it corresponds to a generalization of a mixture distribution, it represents a
summation over the emission models for different settings of the latent variables.
Direct maximization of the likelihood function will therefore lead to complex ex-
pressions with no closed-form solutions, as was the case for simple mixture models
(recall that a mixture model for i.i.d. data is a special case of the HMM).

Section 9.2

We therefore turn to the expectation maximization algorithm to ﬁnd an efﬁcient
framework for maximizing the likelihood function in hidden Markov models. The
EM algorithm starts with some initial selection for the model parameters, which we
denote by θold. In the E step, we take these parameter values and ﬁnd the posterior
distribution of the latent variables p(Z|X, θold). We then use this posterior distri-
bution to evaluate the expectation of the logarithm of the complete-data likelihood
function, as a function of the parameters θ, to give the function Q(θ, θold) deﬁned
by

(cid:2)

Q(θ, θold) =

p(Z|X, θold) ln p(X, Z|θ).

(13.12)

Z

At this point, it is convenient to introduce some notation. We shall use γ(zn) to
denote the marginal posterior distribution of a latent variable zn, and ξ(zn−1, zn) to
denote the joint posterior distribution of two successive latent variables, so that

γ(zn) = p(zn|X, θold)

ξ(zn−1, zn) = p(zn−1, zn|X, θold).

(13.13)
(13.14)

For each value of n, we can store γ(zn) using a set of K nonnegative numbers
that sum to unity, and similarly we can store ξ(zn−1, zn) using a K × K matrix of
nonnegative numbers that again sum to unity. We shall also use γ(znk) to denote the
conditional probability of znk = 1, with a similar use of notation for ξ(zn−1,j, znk)
and for other probabilistic variables introduced later. Because the expectation of a
binary random variable is just the probability that it takes the value 1, we have

γ(znk) = E[znk] =

γ(z)znk

(13.15)

(cid:2)

(cid:2)

ξ(zn−1,j, znk) = E[zn−1,jznk] =

The goal of the E step will be to evaluate the quantities γ(zn) and ξ(zn−1, zn) efﬁ-
ciently, and we shall discuss this in detail shortly.
In the M step, we maximize Q(θ, θold) with respect to the parameters θ =
{π, A, φ} in which we treat γ(zn) and ξ(zn−1, zn) as constant. Maximization with
respect to π and A is easily achieved using appropriate Lagrange multipliers with
the results

The EM algorithm must be initialized by choosing starting values for π and A, which
should of course respect the summation constraints associated with their probabilis-
tic interpretation. Note that any elements of π or A that are set to zero initially will
remain zero in subsequent EM updates. A typical initialization procedure would
involve selecting random starting values for these parameters subject to the summa-
tion and non-negativity constraints. Note that no particular modiﬁcation to the EM
results are required for the case of left-to-right models beyond choosing initial values
for the elements Ajk in which the appropriate elements are set to zero, because these
will remain zero throughout.

To maximize Q(θ, θold) with respect to φk, we notice that only the ﬁnal term
in (13.17) depends on φk, and furthermore this term has exactly the same form as
the data-dependent term in the corresponding function for a standard mixture dis-
tribution for i.i.d. data, as can be seen by comparison with (9.40) for the case of a
Gaussian mixture. Here the quantities γ(znk) are playing the role of the responsibil-
ities. If the parameters φk are independent for the different components, then this
term decouples into a sum of terms one for each value of k, each of which can be
maximized independently. We are then simply maximizing the weighted log likeli-
hood function for the emission density p(x|φk) with weights γ(znk). Here we shall
suppose that this maximization can be done efﬁciently. For instance, in the case of

618

13. SEQUENTIAL DATA

Gaussian emission densities we have p(x|φk) = N (x|µk, Σk), and maximization
of the function Q(θ, θold) then gives

An analogous result holds for Bernoulli observed variables.

The EM algorithm requires initial values for the parameters of the emission dis-
tribution. One way to set these is ﬁrst to treat the data initially as i.i.d. and ﬁt the
emission density by maximum likelihood, and then use the resulting values to ini-
tialize the parameters for EM.

13.2.2 The forward-backward algorithm
Next we seek an efﬁcient procedure for evaluating the quantities γ(znk) and
ξ(zn−1,j, znk), corresponding to the E step of the EM algorithm. The graph for the
hidden Markov model, shown in Figure 13.5, is a tree, and so we know that the
posterior distribution of the latent variables can be obtained efﬁciently using a two-
stage message passing algorithm. In the particular context of the hidden Markov
model, this is known as the forward-backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989), or the
Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum, 1972). There are in fact several variants of the basic
algorithm, all of which lead to the exact marginals, according to the precise form of

13.2. Hidden Markov Models

619

the messages that are propagated along the chain (Jordan, 2007). We shall focus on
the most widely used of these, known as the alpha-beta algorithm.

As well as being of great practical importance in its own right, the forward-
backward algorithm provides us with a nice illustration of many of the concepts
introduced in earlier chapters. We shall therefore begin in this section with a ‘con-
ventional’ derivation of the forward-backward equations, making use of the sum
and product rules of probability, and exploiting conditional independence properties
which we shall obtain from the corresponding graphical model using d-separation.
Then in Section 13.2.3, we shall see how the forward-backward algorithm can be
obtained very simply as a speciﬁc example of the sum-product algorithm introduced
in Section 8.4.4.
It is worth emphasizing that evaluation of the posterior distributions of the latent
variables is independent of the form of the emission density p(x|z) or indeed of
whether the observed variables are continuous or discrete. All we require is the
values of the quantities p(xn|zn) for each value of zn for every n. Also, in this
section and the next we shall omit the explicit dependence on the model parameters
θold because these ﬁxed throughout.

We therefore begin by writing down the following conditional independence

properties (Jordan, 2007)

p(X|zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn|zn)

p(xN +1|X, zN +1) = p(xN +1|zN +1)

p(zN +1|zN , X) = p(zN +1|zN )

p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn)
p(x1, . . . , xn−1|xn, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn)
p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1)
p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn, zn+1) = p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn+1)
p(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1, xn+1) = p(xn+2, . . . , xN|zn+1)
p(X|zn−1, zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1)

(13.24)
(13.25)
(13.26)
(13.27)
(13.28)
p(xn|zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn) (13.29)
(13.30)
(13.31)
where X = {x1, . . . , xN}. These relations are most easily proved using d-separation.
For instance in the ﬁrst of these results, we note that every path from any one of the
nodes x1, . . . , xn−1 to the node xn passes through the node zn, which is observed.
Because all such paths are head-to-tail, it follows that the conditional independence
property must hold. The reader should take a few moments to verify each of these
properties in turn, as an exercise in the application of d-separation. These relations
can also be proved directly, though with signiﬁcantly greater effort, from the joint
distribution for the hidden Markov model using the sum and product rules of proba-
bility.

Let us begin by evaluating γ(znk). Recall that for a discrete multinomial ran-
dom variable the expected value of one of its components is just the probability of
that component having the value 1. Thus we are interested in ﬁnding the posterior
distribution p(zn|x1, . . . , xN ) of zn given the observed data set x1, . . . , xN . This

Exercise 13.10

620

13. SEQUENTIAL DATA

represents a vector of length K whose entries correspond to the expected values of
znk. Using Bayes’ theorem, we have

γ(zn) = p(zn|X) = p(X|zn)p(zn)

p(X)

.

(13.32)

Note that the denominator p(X) is implicitly conditioned on the parameters θold
of the HMM and hence represents the likelihood function. Using the conditional
independence property (13.24), together with the product rule of probability, we
obtain

γ(zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn, zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn)

p(X)

= α(zn)β(zn)

p(X)

(13.33)

where we have deﬁned

α(zn) ≡ p(x1, . . . , xn, zn)
β(zn) ≡ p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn).

(13.34)
(13.35)
The quantity α(zn) represents the joint probability of observing all of the given
data up to time n and the value of zn, whereas β(zn) represents the conditional
probability of all future data from time n + 1 up to N given the value of zn. Again,
α(zn) and β(zn) each represent set of K numbers, one for each of the possible
settings of the 1-of-K coded binary vector zn. We shall use the notation α(znk) to
denote the value of α(zn) when znk = 1, with an analogous interpretation of β(znk).
We now derive recursion relations that allow α(zn) and β(zn) to be evaluated
efﬁciently. Again, we shall make use of conditional independence properties, in
particular (13.25) and (13.26), together with the sum and product rules, allowing us
to express α(zn) in terms of α(zn−1) as follows

α(zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn, zn)

= p(x1, . . . , xn|zn)p(zn)
= p(xn|zn)p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn)p(zn)

Making use of the deﬁnition (13.34) for α(zn), we then obtain
α(zn−1)p(zn|zn−1).

ues of p(zn|zn−1), and then multiplying by the

It is worth taking a moment to study this recursion relation in some detail. Note
that there are K terms in the summation, and the right-hand side has to be evaluated
for each of the K values of zn so each step of the α recursion has computational
cost that scaled like O(K 2). The forward recursion equation for α(zn) is illustrated
using a lattice diagram in Figure 13.12.

In order to start this recursion, we need an initial condition that is given by

α(z1) = p(x1, z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1) =

(13.37)

which tells us that α(z1k), for k = 1, . . . , K, takes the value πkp(x1|φk). Starting
at the ﬁrst node of the chain, we can then work along the chain and evaluate α(zn)
for every latent node. Because each step of the recursion involves multiplying by a
K × K matrix, the overall cost of evaluating these quantities for the whole chain is
of O(K 2N).

We can similarly ﬁnd a recursion relation for the quantities β(zn) by making

use of the conditional independence properties (13.27) and (13.28) giving

β(zn) = p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn)

p(xn+1, . . . , xN , zn+1|zn)

n + 1 and summing them up with weights
given by the products of A1k, correspond-
ing to the values of p(zn+1|zn) and the cor-

β(zn) =

β(zn+1)p(xn+1|zn+1)p(zn+1|zn).

(13.38)

zn+1

Note that in this case we have a backward message passing algorithm that evaluates
β(zn) in terms of β(zn+1). At each step, we absorb the effect of observation xn+1
through the emission probability p(xn+1|zn+1), multiply by the transition matrix
p(zn+1|zn), and then marginalize out zn+1. This is illustrated in Figure 13.13.

Again we need a starting condition for the recursion, namely a value for β(zN ).
This can be obtained by setting n = N in (13.33) and replacing α(zN ) with its
deﬁnition (13.34) to give

p(zN|X) = p(X, zN )β(zN )

p(X)

(13.39)

which we see will be correct provided we take β(zN ) = 1 for all settings of zN .

In the M step equations, the quantity p(X) will cancel out, as can be seen, for

instance, in the M-step equation for µk given by (13.20), which takes the form

However, the quantity p(X) represents the likelihood function whose value we typ-
ically wish to monitor during the EM optimization, and so it is useful to be able to
evaluate it. If we sum both sides of (13.33) over zn, and use the fact that the left-hand
side is a normalized distribution, we obtain

p(X) =

α(zn)β(zn).

(13.41)

(cid:2)

13.2. Hidden Markov Models

Thus we can evaluate the likelihood function by computing this sum, for any conve-
nient choice of n. For instance, if we only want to evaluate the likelihood function,
then we can do this by running the α recursion from the start to the end of the chain,
and then use this result for n = N, making use of the fact that β(zN ) is a vector of
1s. In this case no β recursion is required, and we simply have

p(X) =

α(zN ).

(13.42)

(cid:2)

zN

Let us take a moment to interpret this result for p(X). Recall that to compute the
likelihood we should take the joint distribution p(X, Z) and sum over all possible
values of Z. Each such value represents a particular choice of hidden state for every
time step, in other words every term in the summation is a path through the lattice
diagram, and recall that there are exponentially many such paths. By expressing
the likelihood function in the form (13.42), we have reduced the computational cost
from being exponential in the length of the chain to being linear by swapping the
order of the summation and multiplications, so that at each time step n we sum
the contributions from all paths passing through each of the states znk to give the
intermediate quantities α(zn).
Next we consider the evaluation of the quantities ξ(zn−1, zn), which correspond
to the values of the conditional probabilities p(zn−1, zn|X) for each of the K × K
settings for (zn−1, zn). Using the deﬁnition of ξ(zn−1, zn), and applying Bayes’
theorem, we have
ξ(zn−1, zn) = p(zn−1, zn|X)
= p(X|zn−1, zn)p(zn−1, zn)
= p(x1, . . . , xn−1|zn−1)p(xn|zn)p(xn+1, . . . , xN|zn)p(zn|zn−1)p(zn−1)
= α(zn−1)p(xn|zn)p(zn|zn−1)β(zn)

where we have made use of the conditional independence property (13.29) together
with the deﬁnitions of α(zn) and β(zn) given by (13.34) and (13.35). Thus we can
calculate the ξ(zn−1, zn) directly by using the results of the α and β recursions.

Let us summarize the steps required to train a hidden Markov model using
the EM algorithm. We ﬁrst make an initial selection of the parameters θold where
θ ≡ (π, A, φ). The A and π parameters are often initialized either uniformly or
randomly from a uniform distribution (respecting their non-negativity and summa-
tion constraints). Initialization of the parameters φ will depend on the form of the
distribution. For instance in the case of Gaussians, the parameters µk might be ini-
tialized by applying the K-means algorithm to the data, and Σk might be initialized
to the covariance matrix of the corresponding K means cluster. Then we run both
the forward α recursion and the backward β recursion and use the results to evaluate
γ(zn) and ξ(zn−1, zn). At this stage, we can also evaluate the likelihood function.

624

13. SEQUENTIAL DATA

This completes the E step, and we use the results to ﬁnd a revised set of parameters
θnew using the M-step equations from Section 13.2.1. We then continue to alternate
between E and M steps until some convergence criterion is satisﬁed, for instance
when the change in the likelihood function is below some threshold.
Note that in these recursion relations the observations enter through conditional
distributions of the form p(xn|zn). The recursions are therefore independent of
the type or dimensionality of the observed variables or the form of this conditional
distribution, so long as its value can be computed for each of the K possible states
of zn. Since the observed variables {xn} are ﬁxed, the quantities p(xn|zn) can be
pre-computed as functions of zn at the start of the EM algorithm, and remain ﬁxed
throughout.

Exercise 13.12

We have seen in earlier chapters that the maximum likelihood approach is most
effective when the number of data points is large in relation to the number of parame-
ters. Here we note that a hidden Markov model can be trained effectively, using max-
imum likelihood, provided the training sequence is sufﬁciently long. Alternatively,
we can make use of multiple shorter sequences, which requires a straightforward
modiﬁcation of the hidden Markov model EM algorithm. In the case of left-to-right
models, this is particularly important because, in a given observation sequence, a
given state transition corresponding to a nondiagonal element of A will seen at most
once.
Another quantity of interest is the predictive distribution, in which the observed
data is X = {x1, . . . , xN} and we wish to predict xN +1, which would be important
for real-time applications such as ﬁnancial forecasting. Again we make use of the
sum and product rules together with the conditional independence properties (13.29)
and (13.31) giving

recursion forward to the next step in order to predict the subsequent value xN +2.

Note that in (13.44), the inﬂuence of all data from x1 to xN is summarized in the K
values of α(zN ). Thus the predictive distribution can be carried forward indeﬁnitely
using a ﬁxed amount of storage, as may be required for real-time applications.

Here we have discussed the estimation of the parameters of an HMM using max-
imum likelihood. This framework is easily extended to regularized maximum likeli-
hood by introducing priors over the model parameters π, A and φ whose values are
then estimated by maximizing their posterior probability. This can again be done us-
ing the EM algorithm in which the E step is the same as discussed above, and the M
step involves adding the log of the prior distribution p(θ) to the function Q(θ, θold)
before maximization and represents a straightforward application of the techniques
developed at various points in this book. Furthermore, we can use variational meth-
ods to give a fully Bayesian treatment of the HMM in which we marginalize over the
parameter distributions (MacKay, 1997). As with maximum likelihood, this leads to
a two-pass forward-backward recursion to compute posterior probabilities.

13.2.3 The sum-product algorithm for the HMM
The directed graph that represents the hidden Markov model, shown in Fig-
ure 13.5, is a tree and so we can solve the problem of ﬁnding local marginals for the
hidden variables using the sum-product algorithm. Not surprisingly, this turns out to
be equivalent to the forward-backward algorithm considered in the previous section,
and so the sum-product algorithm therefore provides us with a simple way to derive
the alpha-beta recursion formulae.

We begin by transforming the directed graph of Figure 13.5 into a factor graph,
of which a representative fragment is shown in Figure 13.14. This form of the fac-
tor graph shows all variables, both latent and observed, explicitly. However, for
the purpose of solving the inference problem, we shall always be conditioning on
the variables x1, . . . , xN , and so we can simplify the factor graph by absorbing the
emission probabilities into the transition probability factors. This leads to the sim-
pliﬁed factor graph representation in Figure 13.15, in which the factors are given
by

h(z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1)

fn(zn−1, zn) = p(zn|zn−1)p(xn|zn).

To derive the alpha-beta algorithm, we denote the ﬁnal hidden variable zN as
the root node, and ﬁrst pass messages from the leaf node h to the root. From the
general results (8.66) and (8.69) for message propagation, we see that the messages
which are propagated in the hidden Markov model take the form

µzn−1→fn(zn−1) = µfn−1→zn−1(zn−1)

µfn→zn(zn) =

fn(zn−1, zn)µzn−1→fn(zn−1)

(13.47)

(13.48)

(cid:2)

These equations represent the propagation of messages forward along the chain and
are equivalent to the alpha recursions derived in the previous section, as we shall
now show. Note that because the variable nodes zn have only two neighbours, they
perform no computation.
sion for the f → z messages of the form

We can eliminate µzn−1→fn(zn−1) from (13.48) using (13.47) to give a recur-

(cid:2)

µfn→zn(zn) =

fn(zn−1, zn)µfn−1→zn−1(zn−1).

(13.49)

If we now recall the deﬁnition (13.46), and if we deﬁne

zn−1

α(zn) = µfn→zn(zn)

(13.50)

then we obtain the alpha recursion given by (13.36). We also need to verify that
the quantities α(zn) are themselves equivalent to those deﬁned previously. This
is easily done by using the initial condition (8.71) and noting that α(z1) is given
by h(z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1) which is identical to (13.37). Because the initial α is
the same, and because they are iteratively computed using the same equation, all
subsequent α quantities must be the same.

Next we consider the messages that are propagated from the root node back to

the leaf node. These take the form

(cid:2)

µfn+1→fn(zn) =

fn+1(zn, zn+1)µfn+2→fn+1(zn+1)

(13.51)

zn+1

where, as before, we have eliminated the messages of the type z → f since the
variable nodes perform no computation. Using the deﬁnition (13.46) to substitute
for fn+1(zn, zn+1), and deﬁning

β(zn) = µfn+1→zn(zn)

(13.52)

13.2. Hidden Markov Models

627

we obtain the beta recursion given by (13.38). Again, we can verify that the beta
variables themselves are equivalent by noting that (8.70) implies that the initial mes-
sage send by the root variable node is µzN→fN (zN ) = 1, which is identical to the
initialization of β(zN ) given in Section 13.2.2.

The sum-product algorithm also speciﬁes how to evaluate the marginals once all
the messages have been evaluated. In particular, the result (8.63) shows that the local
marginal at the node zn is given by the product of the incoming messages. Because
we have conditioned on the variables X = {x1, . . . , xN}, we are computing the
joint distribution

p(zn, X) = µfn→zn(zn)µfn+1→zn(zn) = α(zn)β(zn).

(13.53)

Dividing both sides by p(X), we then obtain
γ(zn) = p(zn, X)
p(X)

= α(zn)β(zn)

p(X)

(13.54)

Exercise 13.11

in agreement with (13.33). The result (13.43) can similarly be derived from (8.72).

13.2.4 Scaling factors
There is an important issue that must be addressed before we can make use of the
forward backward algorithm in practice. From the recursion relation (13.36), we note
that at each step the new value α(zn) is obtained from the previous value α(zn−1)
by multiplying by quantities p(zn|zn−1) and p(xn|zn). Because these probabilities
are often signiﬁcantly less than unity, as we work our way forward along the chain,
the values of α(zn) can go to zero exponentially quickly. For moderate lengths of
chain (say 100 or so), the calculation of the α(zn) will soon exceed the dynamic
range of the computer, even if double precision ﬂoating point is used.

In the case of i.i.d. data, we implicitly circumvented this problem with the eval-
uation of likelihood functions by taking logarithms. Unfortunately, this will not help
here because we are forming sums of products of small numbers (we are in fact im-
plicitly summing over all possible paths through the lattice diagram of Figure 13.7).
We therefore work with re-scaled versions of α(zn) and β(zn) whose values remain
of order unity. As we shall see, the corresponding scaling factors cancel out when
we use these re-scaled quantities in the EM algorithm.

In (13.34), we deﬁned α(zn) = p(x1, . . . , xn, zn) representing the joint distri-
bution of all the observations up to xn and the latent variable zn. Now we deﬁne a
normalized version of α given by

(cid:1)α(zn) = p(zn|x1, . . . , xn) =

α(zn)

p(x1, . . . , xn)

(13.55)

which we expect to be well behaved numerically because it is a probability distribu-
tion over K variables for any value of n. In order to relate the scaled and original al-
pha variables, we introduce scaling factors deﬁned by conditional distributions over
the observed variables

cn = p(xn|x1, . . . , xn−1).

(13.56)

628

(cid:23)(cid:1)α(zn).
We can then turn the recursion equation (13.36) for α into one for(cid:1)α given by
(cid:1)α(zn−1)p(zn|zn−1).
Note that at each stage of the forward message passing phase, used to evaluate(cid:1)α(zn),
that normalizes the right-hand side of (13.59) to give(cid:1)α(zn).
We can similarly deﬁne re-scaled variables(cid:1)β(zn) using
(cid:23)(cid:1)β(zn)
tities(cid:1)β(zn) are simply the ratio of two conditional probabilities

which will again remain within machine precision because, from (13.35), the quan-

we have to evaluate and store cn, which is easily done because it is the coefﬁcient

The recursion result (13.38) for β then gives the following recursion for the re-scaled

p(X) =

cn.

Exercise 13.15

Similarly, using (13.33) and (13.43), together with (13.63), we see that the required

γ(zn) = (cid:1)α(zn)(cid:1)β(zn)

ξ(zn−1, zn) = cn(cid:1)α(zn−1)p(xn|zn)p(zn|z−1)(cid:1)β(zn).

Section 13.3

13.2. Hidden Markov Models

629

Finally, we note that there is an alternative formulation of the forward-backward
algorithm (Jordan, 2007) in which the backward pass is deﬁned by a recursion based

the quantities γ(zn) = (cid:1)α(zn)(cid:1)β(zn) instead of using(cid:1)β(zn). This α–γ recursion
requires that the forward pass be completed ﬁrst so that all the quantities (cid:1)α(zn)

are available for the backward pass, whereas the forward and backward passes of
the α–β algorithm can be done independently. Although these two algorithms have
comparable computational cost, the α–β version is the most commonly encountered
one in the case of hidden Markov models, whereas for linear dynamical systems a
recursion analogous to the α–γ form is more usual.

13.2.5 The Viterbi algorithm
In many applications of hidden Markov models, the latent variables have some
meaningful interpretation, and so it is often of interest to ﬁnd the most probable
sequence of hidden states for a given observation sequence. For instance in speech
recognition, we might wish to ﬁnd the most probable phoneme sequence for a given
series of acoustic observations. Because the graph for the hidden Markov model is
a directed tree, this problem can be solved exactly using the max-sum algorithm.
We recall from our discussion in Section 8.4.5 that the problem of ﬁnding the most
probable sequence of latent states is not the same as that of ﬁnding the set of states
that are individually the most probable. The latter problem can be solved by ﬁrst
running the forward-backward (sum-product) algorithm to ﬁnd the latent variable
marginals γ(zn) and then maximizing each of these individually (Duda et al., 2001).
However, the set of such states will not, in general, correspond to the most probable
sequence of states. In fact, this set of states might even represent a sequence having
zero probability, if it so happens that two successive states, which in isolation are
individually the most probable, are such that the transition matrix element connecting
them is zero.

In practice, we are usually interested in ﬁnding the most probable sequence of
states, and this can be solved efﬁciently using the max-sum algorithm, which in the
context of hidden Markov models is known as the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967).
Note that the max-sum algorithm works with log probabilities and so there is no
need to use re-scaled variables as was done with the forward-backward algorithm.
Figure 13.16 shows a fragment of the hidden Markov model expanded as lattice
diagram. As we have already noted, the number of possible paths through the lattice
grows exponentially with the length of the chain. The Viterbi algorithm searches this
space of paths efﬁciently to ﬁnd the most probable path with a computational cost
that grows only linearly with the length of the chain.

As with the sum-product algorithm, we ﬁrst represent the hidden Markov model
as a factor graph, as shown in Figure 13.15. Again, we treat the variable node zN
as the root, and pass messages to the root starting with the leaf nodes. Using the
results (8.93) and (8.94), we see that the messages passed in the max-sum algorithm
are given by

(cid:27)

efﬁciently determines the most probable path from

any given path, the corresponding probability is
given by the product of the elements of the tran-
sition matrix Ajk, corresponding to the probabil-
ities p(zn+1|zn) for each segment of the path,
along with the emission densities p(xn|k) asso-
ciated with each node on the path.

If we eliminate µzn→fn+1(zn) between these two equations, and make use of (13.46),
we obtain a recursion for the f → z messages of the form

ω(zn+1) = ln p(xn+1|zn+1) + max

zn

{ln p(x+1|zn) + ω(zn)}

(13.68)

where we have introduced the notation ω(zn) ≡ µfn→zn(zn).
From (8.95) and (8.96), these messages are initialized using

ω(z1) = ln p(z1) + ln p(x1|z1).

(13.69)

where we have used (13.45). Note that to keep the notation uncluttered, we omit
the dependence on the model parameters θ that are held ﬁxed when ﬁnding the most
probable sequence.

Exercise 13.16

The Viterbi algorithm can also be derived directly from the deﬁnition (13.6) of
the joint distribution by taking the logarithm and then exchanging maximizations
and summations. It is easily seen that the quantities ω(zn) have the probabilistic
interpretation

ω(zn) = max

p(x1, . . . , xn, z1, . . . , zn).

z1,...,zn−1

(13.70)

Once we have completed the ﬁnal maximization over zN , we will obtain the
value of the joint distribution p(X, Z) corresponding to the most probable path. We
also wish to ﬁnd the sequence of latent variable values that corresponds to this path.
To do this, we simply make use of the back-tracking procedure discussed in Sec-
tion 8.4.5. Speciﬁcally, we note that the maximization over zn must be performed
for each of the K possible values of zn+1. Suppose we keep a record of the values
of zn that correspond to the maxima for each value of the K values of zn+1. Let us
denote this function by ψ(kn) where k ∈ {1, . . . , K}. Once we have passed mes-
sages to the end of the chain and found the most probable state of zN , we can then
use this function to backtrack along the chain by applying it recursively

kmax
n = ψ(kmax

n+1).

(13.71)

13.2. Hidden Markov Models

631

Intuitively, we can understand the Viterbi algorithm as follows. Naively, we
could consider explicitly all of the exponentially many paths through the lattice,
evaluate the probability for each, and then select the path having the highest proba-
bility. However, we notice that we can make a dramatic saving in computational cost
as follows. Suppose that for each path we evaluate its probability by summing up
products of transition and emission probabilities as we work our way forward along
each path through the lattice. Consider a particular time step n and a particular state
k at that time step. There will be many possible paths converging on the correspond-
ing node in the lattice diagram. However, we need only retain that particular path
that so far has the highest probability. Because there are K states at time step n, we
need to keep track of K such paths. At time step n + 1, there will be K 2 possible
paths to consider, comprising K possible paths leading out of each of the K current
states, but again we need only retain K of these corresponding to the best path for
each state at time n+1. When we reach the ﬁnal time step N we will discover which
state corresponds to the overall most probable path. Because there is a unique path
coming into that state we can trace the path back to step N − 1 to see what state it
occupied at that time, and so on back through the lattice to the state n = 1.

13.2.6 Extensions of the hidden Markov model
The basic hidden Markov model, along with the standard training algorithm
based on maximum likelihood, has been extended in numerous ways to meet the
requirements of particular applications. Here we discuss a few of the more important
examples.

We see from the digits example in Figure 13.11 that hidden Markov models can
be quite poor generative models for the data, because many of the synthetic digits
look quite unrepresentative of the training data. If the goal is sequence classiﬁca-
tion, there can be signiﬁcant beneﬁt in determining the parameters of hidden Markov
models using discriminative rather than maximum likelihood techniques. Suppose
we have a training set of R observation sequences Xr, where r = 1, . . . , R, each of
which is labelled according to its class m, where m = 1, . . . , M. For each class, we
have a separate hidden Markov model with its own parameters θm, and we treat the
problem of determining the parameter values as a standard classiﬁcation problem in
which we optimize the cross-entropy

ln p(mr|Xr).

(13.72)

Using Bayes’ theorem this can be expressed in terms of the sequence probabilities
associated with the hidden Markov models

where p(m) is the prior probability of class m. Optimization of this cost function
is more complex than for maximum likelihood (Kapadia, 1998), and in particular

requires that every training sequence be evaluated under each of the models in or-
der to compute the denominator in (13.73). Hidden Markov models, coupled with
discriminative training methods, are widely used in speech recognition (Kapadia,
1998).

A signiﬁcant weakness of the hidden Markov model is the way in which it rep-
resents the distribution of times for which the system remains in a given state. To see
the problem, note that the probability that a sequence sampled from a given hidden
Markov model will spend precisely T steps in state k and then make a transition to a
different state is given by

p(T ) = (Akk)T (1 − Akk) ∝ exp (−T ln Akk)

(13.74)

and so is an exponentially decaying function of T . For many applications, this will
be a very unrealistic model of state duration. The problem can be resolved by mod-
elling state duration directly in which the diagonal coefﬁcients Akk are all set to zero,
and each state k is explicitly associated with a probability distribution p(T|k) of pos-
sible duration times. From a generative point of view, when a state k is entered, a
value T representing the number of time steps that the system will remain in state k
is then drawn from p(T|k). The model then emits T values of the observed variable
xt, which are generally assumed to be independent so that the corresponding emis-
t=1 p(xt|k). This approach requires some straightforward
sion density is simply
modiﬁcations to the EM optimization procedure (Rabiner, 1989).

(cid:21)T

Another limitation of the standard HMM is that it is poor at capturing long-
range correlations between the observed variables (i.e., between variables that are
separated by many time steps) because these must be mediated via the ﬁrst-order
Markov chain of hidden states. Longer-range effects could in principle be included
by adding extra links to the graphical model of Figure 13.5. One way to address this
is to generalize the HMM to give the autoregressive hidden Markov model (Ephraim
et al., 1989), an example of which is shown in Figure 13.17. For discrete observa-
tions, this corresponds to expanded tables of conditional probabilities for the emis-
sion distributions. In the case of a Gaussian emission density, we can use the linear-
Gaussian framework in which the conditional distribution for xn given the values
of the previous observations, and the value of zn, is a Gaussian whose mean is a
linear combination of the values of the conditioning variables. Clearly the number
of additional links in the graph must be limited to avoid an excessive the number of
free parameters. In the example shown in Figure 13.17, each observation depends on

Figure 13.18 Example of an input-output hidden
Markov model.
In this case, both the
emission probabilities and the transition
probabilities depend on the values of a
sequence of observations u1, . . . , uN .

the two preceding observed variables as well as on the hidden state. Although this
graph looks messy, we can again appeal to d-separation to see that in fact it still has
a simple probabilistic structure. In particular, if we imagine conditioning on zn we
see that, as with the standard HMM, the values of zn−1 and zn+1 are independent,
corresponding to the conditional independence property (13.5). This is easily veri-
ﬁed by noting that every path from node zn−1 to node zn+1 passes through at least
one observed node that is head-to-tail with respect to that path. As a consequence,
we can again use a forward-backward recursion in the E step of the EM algorithm to
determine the posterior distributions of the latent variables in a computational time
that is linear in the length of the chain. Similarly, the M step involves only a minor
modiﬁcation of the standard M-step equations. In the case of Gaussian emission
densities this involves estimating the parameters using the standard linear regression
equations, discussed in Chapter 3.

We have seen that the autoregressive HMM appears as a natural extension of the
standard HMM when viewed as a graphical model. In fact the probabilistic graphical
modelling viewpoint motivates a plethora of different graphical structures based on
the HMM. Another example is the input-output hidden Markov model (Bengio and
Frasconi, 1995), in which we have a sequence of observed variables u1, . . . , uN , in
addition to the output variables x1, . . . , xN , whose values inﬂuence either the dis-
tribution of latent variables or output variables, or both. An example is shown in
Figure 13.18. This extends the HMM framework to the domain of supervised learn-
ing for sequential data. It is again easy to show, through the use of the d-separation
criterion, that the Markov property (13.5) for the chain of latent variables still holds.
To verify this, simply note that there is only one path from node zn−1 to node zn+1
and this is head-to-tail with respect to the observed node zn. This conditional inde-
pendence property again allows the formulation of a computationally efﬁcient learn-
ing algorithm. In particular, we can determine the parameters θ of the model by
maximizing the likelihood function L(θ) = p(X|U, θ) where U is a matrix whose
rows are given by uT
n. As a consequence of the conditional independence property
(13.5) this likelihood function can be maximized efﬁciently using an EM algorithm
in which the E step involves forward and backward recursions.

Another variant of the HMM worthy of mention is the factorial hidden Markov
model (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1997), in which there are multiple independent

Markov chains of latent variables, and the distribution of the observed variable at
a given time step is conditional on the states of all of the corresponding latent vari-
ables at that same time step. Figure 13.19 shows the corresponding graphical model.
The motivation for considering factorial HMM can be seen by noting that in order to
represent, say, 10 bits of information at a given time step, a standard HMM would
need K = 210 = 1024 latent states, whereas a factorial HMM could make use of 10
binary latent chains. The primary disadvantage of factorial HMMs, however, lies in
the additional complexity of training them. The M step for the factorial HMM model
is straightforward. However, observation of the x variables introduces dependencies
between the latent chains, leading to difﬁculties with the E step. This can be seen
by noting that in Figure 13.19, the variables z(1)
n are connected by a path
which is head-to-head at node xn and hence they are not d-separated. The exact E
step for this model does not correspond to running forward and backward recursions
along the M Markov chains independently. This is conﬁrmed by noting that the key
conditional independence property (13.5) is not satisﬁed for the individual Markov
chains in the factorial HMM model, as is shown using d-separation in Figure 13.20.
Now suppose that there are M chains of hidden nodes and for simplicity suppose
that all latent variables have the same number K of states. Then one approach would
be to note that there are KM combinations of latent variables at a given time step

and so we can transform the model into an equivalent standard HMM having a single
chain of latent variables each of which has KM latent states. We can then run the
standard forward-backward recursions in the E step. This has computational com-
plexity O(N K 2M ) that is exponential in the number M of latent chains and so will
be intractable for anything other than small values of M. One solution would be
to use sampling methods (discussed in Chapter 11). As an elegant deterministic al-
ternative, Ghahramani and Jordan (1997) exploited variational inference techniques
to obtain a tractable algorithm for approximate inference. This can be done using
a simple variational posterior distribution that is fully factorized with respect to the
latent variables, or alternatively by using a more powerful approach in which the
variational distribution is described by independent Markov chains corresponding to
the chains of latent variables in the original model. In the latter case, the variational
inference algorithms involves running independent forward and backward recursions
along each chain, which is computationally efﬁcient and yet is also able to capture
correlations between variables within the same chain.

Clearly, there are many possible probabilistic structures that can be constructed
according to the needs of particular applications. Graphical models provide a general
technique for motivating, describing, and analysing such structures, and variational
methods provide a powerful framework for performing inference in those models for
which exact solution is intractable.

13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems

In order to motivate the concept of linear dynamical systems, let us consider the
following simple problem, which often arises in practical settings. Suppose we wish
to measure the value of an unknown quantity z using a noisy sensor that returns a
observation x representing the value of z plus zero-mean Gaussian noise. Given a
single measurement, our best guess for z is to assume that z = x. However, we
can improve our estimate for z by taking lots of measurements and averaging them,
because the random noise terms will tend to cancel each other. Now let’s make the
situation more complicated by assuming that we wish to measure a quantity z that
is changing over time. We can take regular measurements of x so that at some point
in time we have obtained x1, . . . , xN and we wish to ﬁnd the corresponding values
z1, . . . , xN . If we simply average the measurements, the error due to random noise
will be reduced, but unfortunately we will just obtain a single averaged estimate, in
which we have averaged over the changing value of z, thereby introducing a new
source of error.

Intuitively, we could imagine doing a bit better as follows. To estimate the value
of zN , we take only the most recent few measurements, say xN−L, . . . , xN and just
average these. If z is changing slowly, and the random noise level in the sensor is
high, it would make sense to choose a relatively long window of observations to
average. Conversely, if the signal is changing quickly, and the noise levels are small,
we might be better just to use xN directly as our estimate of zN . Perhaps we could
do even better if we take a weighted average, in which more recent measurements

636

13. SEQUENTIAL DATA

make a greater contribution than less recent ones.

Although this sort of intuitive argument seems plausible, it does not tell us how
to form a weighted average, and any sort of hand-crafted weighing is hardly likely
to be optimal. Fortunately, we can address problems such as this much more sys-
tematically by deﬁning a probabilistic model that captures the time evolution and
measurement processes and then applying the inference and learning methods devel-
oped in earlier chapters. Here we shall focus on a widely used model known as a
linear dynamical system.

As we have seen, the HMM corresponds to the state space model shown in
Figure 13.5 in which the latent variables are discrete but with arbitrary emission
probability distributions. This graph of course describes a much broader class of
probability distributions, all of which factorize according to (13.6). We now consider
extensions to other distributions for the latent variables. In particular, we consider
continuous latent variables in which the summations of the sum-product algorithm
become integrals. The general form of the inference algorithms will, however, be
the same as for the hidden Markov model. It is interesting to note that, historically,
hidden Markov models and linear dynamical systems were developed independently.
Once they are both expressed as graphical models, however, the deep relationship
between them immediately becomes apparent.

One key requirement is that we retain an efﬁcient algorithm for inference which
is linear in the length of the chain. This requires that, for instance, when we take
x1, . . . , xn, and multiply by the transition probability p(zn|zn−1) and the emission
probability p(xn|zn) and then marginalize over zn−1, we obtain a distribution over

a quantity(cid:1)α(zn−1), representing the posterior probability of zn given observations
zn that is of the same functional form as that over (cid:1)α(zn−1). That is to say, the

distribution must not become more complex at each stage, but must only change in
its parameter values. Not surprisingly, the only distributions that have this property
of being closed under multiplication are those belonging to the exponential family.
Here we consider the most important example from a practical perspective,
which is the Gaussian. In particular, we consider a linear-Gaussian state space model
so that the latent variables {zn}, as well as the observed variables {xn}, are multi-
variate Gaussian distributions whose means are linear functions of the states of their
parents in the graph. We have seen that a directed graph of linear-Gaussian units
is equivalent to a joint Gaussian distribution over all of the variables. Furthermore,

marginals such as(cid:1)α(zn) are also Gaussian, so that the functional form of the mes-
each of which has a mean that is linear in zn. Then even if(cid:1)α(z1) is Gaussian, the
quantity(cid:1)α(z2) will be a mixture of K Gaussians, (cid:1)α(z3) will be a mixture of K 2

sages is preserved and we will obtain an efﬁcient inference algorithm. By contrast,
suppose that the emission densities p(xn|zn) comprise a mixture of K Gaussians

Gaussians, and so on, and exact inference will not be of practical value.

We have seen that the hidden Markov model can be viewed as an extension of
the mixture models of Chapter 9 to allow for sequential correlations in the data.
In a similar way, we can view the linear dynamical system as a generalization of the
continuous latent variable models of Chapter 12 such as probabilistic PCA and factor
analysis. Each pair of nodes {zn, xn} represents a linear-Gaussian latent variable

13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems

637

model for that particular observation. However, the latent variables {zn} are no
longer treated as independent but now form a Markov chain.

Because the model is represented by a tree-structured directed graph, inference
problems can be solved efﬁciently using the sum-product algorithm. The forward re-
cursions, analogous to the α messages of the hidden Markov model, are known as the
Kalman ﬁlter equations (Kalman, 1960; Zarchan and Musoff, 2005), and the back-
ward recursions, analogous to the β messages, are known as the Kalman smoother
equations, or the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) equations (Rauch et al., 1965). The
Kalman ﬁlter is widely used in many real-time tracking applications.

Because the linear dynamical system is a linear-Gaussian model, the joint distri-
bution over all variables, as well as all marginals and conditionals, will be Gaussian.
It follows that the sequence of individually most probable latent variable values is
the same as the most probable latent sequence. There is thus no need to consider the
analogue of the Viterbi algorithm for the linear dynamical system.

Because the model has linear-Gaussian conditional distributions, we can write

the transition and emission distributions in the general form
p(zn|zn−1) = N (zn|Azn−1, Γ)
p(xn|zn) = N (xn|Czn, Σ).

The initial latent variable also has a Gaussian distribution which we write as

p(z1) = N (z1|µ0, V0).

(13.75)
(13.76)

(13.77)

Exercise 13.19

Exercise 13.24

Note that in order to simplify the notation, we have omitted additive constant terms
from the means of the Gaussians. In fact, it is straightforward to include them if
desired. Traditionally, these distributions are more commonly expressed in an equiv-
alent form in terms of noisy linear equations given by

zn = Azn−1 + wn
xn = Czn + vn
z1 = µ0 + u

(13.78)
(13.79)
(13.80)

where the noise terms have the distributions

w ∼ N (w|0, Γ)
v ∼ N (v|0, Σ)
u ∼ N (u|0, V0).

(13.81)
(13.82)
(13.83)
The parameters of the model, denoted by θ = {A, Γ, C, Σ, µ0, V0}, can be
determined using maximum likelihood through the EM algorithm. In the E step, we
need to solve the inference problem of determining the local posterior marginals for
the latent variables, which can be solved efﬁciently using the sum-product algorithm,
as we discuss in the next section.

638

13. SEQUENTIAL DATA

13.3.1 Inference in LDS
We now turn to the problem of ﬁnding the marginal distributions for the latent
variables conditional on the observation sequence. For given parameter settings, we
also wish to make predictions of the next latent state zn and of the next observation
xn conditioned on the observed data x1, . . . , xn−1 for use in real-time applications.
These inference problems can be solved efﬁciently using the sum-product algorithm,
which in the context of the linear dynamical system gives rise to the Kalman ﬁlter
and Kalman smoother equations.

It is worth emphasizing that because the linear dynamical system is a linear-
Gaussian model, the joint distribution over all latent and observed variables is simply
a Gaussian, and so in principle we could solve inference problems by using the
standard results derived in previous chapters for the marginals and conditionals of a
multivariate Gaussian. The role of the sum-product algorithm is to provide a more
efﬁcient way to perform such computations.

Linear dynamical systems have the identical factorization, given by (13.6), to
hidden Markov models, and are again described by the factor graphs in Figures 13.14
and 13.15. Inference algorithms therefore take precisely the same form except that
summations over latent variables are replaced by integrations. We begin by consid-
ering the forward equations in which we treat zN as the root node, and propagate
messages from the leaf node h(z1) to the root. From (13.77), the initial message will
be Gaussian, and because each of the factors is Gaussian, all subsequent messages
will also be Gaussian. By convention, we shall propagate messages that are nor-
malized marginal distributions corresponding to p(zn|x1, . . . , xn), which we denote
by

This is precisely analogous to the propagation of scaled variables(cid:1)α(zn) given by

(cid:1)α(zn) = N (zn|µn, Vn).

(13.84)

(13.59) in the discrete case of the hidden Markov model, and so the recursion equa-
tion now takes the form

cn(cid:1)α(zn) = p(xn|zn)

(cid:6) (cid:1)α(zn−1)p(zn|zn−1) dzn−1.

(13.85)
Substituting for the conditionals p(zn|zn−1) and p(xn|zn), using (13.75) and (13.76),
respectively, and making use of (13.84), we see that (13.85) becomes

(cid:6)
cnN (zn|µn, Vn) = N (xn|Czn, Σ)

N (zn|Azn−1, Γ)N (zn−1|µn−1, Vn−1) dzn−1.
(cid:6)

Here we are supposing that µn−1 and Vn−1 are known, and by evaluating the inte-
gral in (13.86), we wish to determine values for µn and Vn. The integral is easily
evaluated by making use of the result (2.115), from which it follows that
N (zn|Azn−1, Γ)N (zn−1|µn−1, Vn−1) dzn−1

(13.86)

= N (zn|Aµn−1, Pn−1)

(13.87)

13.3. Linear Dynamical Systems

639

where we have deﬁned

Pn−1 = AVn−1AT + Γ.

(13.88)

We can now combine this result with the ﬁrst factor on the right-hand side of (13.86)
by making use of (2.115) and (2.116) to give

µn = Aµn−1 + Kn(xn − CAµn−1)
Vn = (I − KnC)Pn−1
cn = N (xn|CAµn−1, CPn−1CT + Σ).

(13.89)
(13.90)

Here we have made use of the matrix inverse identities (C.5) and (C.7) and also
deﬁned the Kalman gain matrix

(cid:11)−1

Kn = Pn−1CT

CPn−1CT + Σ

.

(13.92)

Thus, given the values of µn−1 and Vn−1, together with the new observation xn,
we can evaluate the Gaussian marginal for zn having mean µn and covariance Vn,
as well as the normalization coefﬁcient cn.

The initial conditions for these recursion equations are obtained from

c1(cid:1)α(z1) = p(z1)p(x1|z1).

(13.93)
Because p(z1) is given by (13.77), and p(x1|z1) is given by (13.76), we can again
make use of (2.115) to calculate c1 and (2.116) to calculate µ1 and V1 giving

(cid:10)

(cid:10)

µ1 = µ0 + K1(x1 − Cµ0)
V1 = (I − K1C)V0
c1 = N (x1|Cµ0, CV0CT + Σ)

(cid:11)−1

where

K1 = V0CT

CV0CT + Σ

.

(13.94)
(13.95)
(13.96)

(13.97)

Similarly, the likelihood function for the linear dynamical system is given by (13.63)
in which the factors cn are found using the Kalman ﬁltering equations.

We can interpret the steps involved in going from the posterior marginal over
zn−1 to the posterior marginal over zn as follows.
In (13.89), we can view the
quantity Aµn−1 as the prediction of the mean over zn obtained by simply taking the
mean over zn−1 and projecting it forward one step using the transition probability
matrix A. This predicted mean would give a predicted observation for xn given by
CAzn−1 obtained by applying the emission probability matrix C to the predicted
hidden state mean. We can view the update equation (13.89) for the mean of the
hidden variable distribution as taking the predicted mean Aµn−1 and then adding
a correction that is proportional to the error xn − CAzn−1 between the predicted
observation and the actual observation. The coefﬁcient of this correction is given by
the Kalman gain matrix. Thus we can view the Kalman ﬁlter as a process of making
successive predictions and then correcting these predictions in the light of the new
observations. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 13.21.

Figure 13.21 The linear dynamical system can be viewed as a sequence of steps in which increasing un-
certainty in the state variable due to diffusion is compensated by the arrival of new data. In the left-hand plot,
the blue curve shows the distribution p(zn−1|x1, . . . , xn−1), which incorporates all the data up to step n − 1.
The diffusion arising from the nonzero variance of the transition probability p(zn|zn−1) gives the distribution
p(zn|x1, . . . , xn−1), shown in red in the centre plot. Note that this is broader and shifted relative to the blue curve
(which is shown dashed in the centre plot for comparison). The next data observation xn contributes through the
emission density p(xn|zn), which is shown as a function of zn in green on the right-hand plot. Note that this is not
a density with respect to zn and so is not normalized to one. Inclusion of this new data point leads to a revised
distribution p(zn|x1, . . . , xn) for the state density shown in blue. We see that observation of the data has shifted
and narrowed the distribution compared to p(zn|x1, . . . , xn−1) (which is shown in dashed in the right-hand plot
for comparison).

Exercise 13.27

Exercise 13.28

If we consider a situation in which the measurement noise is small compared
to the rate at which the latent variable is evolving, then we ﬁnd that the posterior
distribution for zn depends only on the current measurement xn, in accordance with
the intuition from our simple example at the start of the section. Similarly, if the
latent variable is evolving slowly relative to the observation noise level, we ﬁnd that
the posterior mean for zn is obtained by averaging all of the measurements obtained
up to that time.

One of the most important applications of the Kalman ﬁlter is to tracking, and
this is illustrated using a simple example of an object moving in two dimensions in
Figure 13.22.

So far, we have solved the inference problem of ﬁnding the posterior marginal
for a node zn given observations from x1 up to xn. Next we turn to the problem of
ﬁnding the marginal for a node zn given all observations x1 to xN . For temporal
data, this corresponds to the inclusion of future as well as past observations. Al-
though this cannot be used for real-time prediction, it plays a key role in learning the
parameters of the model. By analogy with the hidden Markov model, this problem
can be solved by propagating messages from node xN back to node x1 and com-
bining this information with that obtained during the forward message passing stage

So far, we have considered the inference problem for linear dynamical systems,
assuming that the model parameters θ = {A, Γ, C, Σ, µ0, V0} are known. Next, we
consider the determination of these parameters using maximum likelihood (Ghahra-
mani and Hinton, 1996b). Because the model has latent variables, this can be ad-
dressed using the EM algorithm, which was discussed in general terms in Chapter 9.
We can derive the EM algorithm for the linear dynamical system as follows. Let
us denote the estimated parameter values at some particular cycle of the algorithm
by θold. For these parameter values, we can run the inference algorithm to determine
the posterior distribution of the latent variables p(Z|X, θold), or more precisely those

13. SEQUENTIAL DATA

We have approached parameter learning in the linear dynamical system using
maximum likelihood. Inclusion of priors to give a MAP estimate is straightforward,
and a fully Bayesian treatment can be found by applying the analytical approxima-
tion techniques discussed in Chapter 10, though a detailed treatment is precluded
here due to lack of space.

13.3.3 Extensions of LDS
As with the hidden Markov model, there is considerable interest in extending
the basic linear dynamical system in order to increase its capabilities. Although the
assumption of a linear-Gaussian model leads to efﬁcient algorithms for inference
and learning, it also implies that the marginal distribution of the observed variables
is simply a Gaussian, which represents a signiﬁcant limitation. One simple extension
of the linear dynamical system is to use a Gaussian mixture as the initial distribution
for z1.
If this mixture has K components, then the forward recursion equations
(13.85) will lead to a mixture of K Gaussians over each hidden variable zn, and so
the model is again tractable.

For many applications, the Gaussian emission density is a poor approximation.
If instead we try to use a mixture of K Gaussians as the emission density, then the

posterior(cid:1)α(z1) will also be a mixture of K Gaussians. However, from (13.85) the
posterior(cid:1)α(z2) will comprise a mixture of K 2 Gaussians, and so on, with(cid:1)α(zn)

being given by a mixture of K n Gaussians. Thus the number of components grows
exponentially with the length of the chain, and so this model is impractical.

Chapter 10

More generally, introducing transition or emission models that depart from the
linear-Gaussian (or other exponential family) model leads to an intractable infer-
ence problem. We can make deterministic approximations such as assumed den-
sity ﬁltering or expectation propagation, or we can make use of sampling methods,
as discussed in Section 13.3.4. One widely used approach is to make a Gaussian
approximation by linearizing around the mean of the predicted distribution, which
gives rise to the extended Kalman ﬁlter (Zarchan and Musoff, 2005).

As with hidden Markov models, we can develop interesting extensions of the ba-
sic linear dynamical system by expanding its graphical representation. For example,
the switching state space model (Ghahramani and Hinton, 1998) can be viewed as
a combination of the hidden Markov model with a set of linear dynamical systems.
The model has multiple Markov chains of continuous linear-Gaussian latent vari-
ables, each of which is analogous to the latent chain of the linear dynamical system
discussed earlier, together with a Markov chain of discrete variables of the form used
in a hidden Markov model. The output at each time step is determined by stochas-
tically choosing one of the continuous latent chains, using the state of the discrete
latent variable as a switch, and then emitting an observation from the corresponding
conditional output distribution. Exact inference in this model is intractable, but vari-
ational methods lead to an efﬁcient inference scheme involving forward-backward
recursions along each of the continuous and discrete Markov chains independently.
Note that, if we consider multiple chains of discrete latent variables, and use one as
the switch to select from the remainder, we obtain an analogous model having only
discrete latent variables known as the switching hidden Markov model.

13.3.4 Particle ﬁlters
For dynamical systems which do not have a linear-Gaussian, for example, if
they use a non-Gaussian emission density, we can turn to sampling methods in order
to ﬁnd a tractable inference algorithm. In particular, we can apply the sampling-
importance-resampling formalism of Section 11.1.5 to obtain a sequential Monte
Carlo algorithm known as the particle ﬁlter.

Consider the class of distributions represented by the graphical model in Fig-
ure 13.5, and suppose we are given the observed values Xn = (x1, . . . , xn) and
we wish to draw L samples from the posterior distribution p(zn|Xn). Using Bayes’
theorem, we have

w(l)

n f(z(l)
n )

(13.117)

where {z(l)
n } is a set of samples drawn from p(zn|Xn−1) and we have made use of
the conditional independence property p(xn|zn, Xn−1) = p(xn|zn), which follows
from the graph in Figure 13.5. The sampling weights {w

n } are deﬁned by

(l)

(cid:5)L

p(xn|z(l)
n )
m=1 p(xn|z(m)
n )

w(l)

n =

(13.118)

where the same samples are used in the numerator as in the denominator. Thus the
(cid:5)
posterior distribution p(zn|xn) is represented by the set of samples {z(l)
n } together
with the corresponding weights {w
(l)
n 1
and

n }. Note that these weights satisfy 0 (cid:1) w

(l)
n = 1.

(l)

Because we wish to ﬁnd a sequential sampling scheme, we shall suppose that
a set of samples and weights have been obtained at time step n, and that we have
subsequently observed the value of xn+1, and we wish to ﬁnd the weights and sam-
ples at time step n + 1. We ﬁrst sample from the distribution p(zn+1|Xn). This is

which follow from the application of the d-separation criterion to the graph in Fig-
ure 13.5. The distribution given by (13.119) is a mixture distribution, and samples
can be drawn by choosing a component l with probability given by the mixing coef-
ﬁcients w(l) and then drawing a sample from the corresponding component.

In summary, we can view each step of the particle ﬁlter algorithm as comprising
two stages. At time step n, we have a sample representation of the posterior dis-
tribution p(zn|Xn) expressed as samples {z(l)
n }.
This can be viewed as a mixture representation of the form (13.119). To obtain the
corresponding representation for the next time step, we ﬁrst draw L samples from
the mixture distribution (13.119), and then for each sample we use the new obser-
n+1). This is

Combining

Models

In earlier chapters, we have explored a range of different models for solving classiﬁ-
cation and regression problems. It is often found that improved performance can be
obtained by combining multiple models together in some way, instead of just using
a single model in isolation. For instance, we might train L different models and then
make predictions using the average of the predictions made by each model. Such
combinations of models are sometimes called committees. In Section 14.2, we dis-
cuss ways to apply the committee concept in practice, and we also give some insight
into why it can sometimes be an effective procedure.

One important variant of the committee method, known as boosting, involves
training multiple models in sequence in which the error function used to train a par-
ticular model depends on the performance of the previous models. This can produce
substantial improvements in performance compared to the use of a single model and
is discussed in Section 14.3.

Instead of averaging the predictions of a set of models, an alternative form of

653

654

14. COMBINING MODELS

model combination is to select one of the models to make the prediction, in which
the choice of model is a function of the input variables. Thus different models be-
come responsible for making predictions in different regions of input space. One
widely used framework of this kind is known as a decision tree in which the selec-
tion process can be described as a sequence of binary selections corresponding to
the traversal of a tree structure and is discussed in Section 14.4. In this case, the
individual models are generally chosen to be very simple, and the overall ﬂexibility
of the model arises from the input-dependent selection process. Decision trees can
be applied to both classiﬁcation and regression problems.

One limitation of decision trees is that the division of input space is based on
hard splits in which only one model is responsible for making predictions for any
given value of the input variables. The decision process can be softened by moving
to a probabilistic framework for combining models, as discussed in Section 14.5. For
example, if we have a set of K models for a conditional distribution p(t|x, k) where
x is the input variable, t is the target variable, and k = 1, . . . , K indexes the model,
then we can form a probabilistic mixture of the form

K(cid:2)

p(t|x) =

πk(x)p(t|x, k)

(14.1)

k=1

in which πk(x) = p(k|x) represent the input-dependent mixing coefﬁcients. Such
models can be viewed as mixture distributions in which the component densities, as
well as the mixing coefﬁcients, are conditioned on the input variables and are known
as mixtures of experts. They are closely related to the mixture density network model
discussed in Section 5.6.

14.1. Bayesian Model Averaging

It is important to distinguish between model combination methods and Bayesian
model averaging, as the two are often confused. To understand the difference, con-
sider the example of density estimation using a mixture of Gaussians in which several
Gaussian components are combined probabilistically. The model contains a binary
latent variable z that indicates which component of the mixture is responsible for
generating the corresponding data point. Thus the model is speciﬁed in terms of a
joint distribution

(14.2)
and the corresponding density over the observed variable x is obtained by marginal-
izing over the latent variable

p(x) =

p(x, z).

marginal probability of a data set X = {x1, . . . , xN} in the form

(cid:31)(cid:2)

N(cid:14)

N(cid:14)

p(X) =

p(xn) =

p(xn, zn)

.

(14.5)

n=1

n=1

zn

Thus we see that each observed data point xn has a corresponding latent variable zn.
Now suppose we have several different models indexed by h = 1, . . . , H with
prior probabilities p(h). For instance one model might be a mixture of Gaussians and
another model might be a mixture of Cauchy distributions. The marginal distribution
over the data set is given by

p(X) =

p(X|h)p(h).

(14.6)

h=1

This is an example of Bayesian model averaging. The interpretation of this summa-
tion over h is that just one model is responsible for generating the whole data set,
and the probability distribution over h simply reﬂects our uncertainty as to which
model that is. As the size of the data set increases, this uncertainty reduces, and
the posterior probabilities p(h|X) become increasingly focussed on just one of the
models.

This highlights the key difference between Bayesian model averaging and model
combination, because in Bayesian model averaging the whole data set is generated
by a single model. By contrast, when we combine multiple models, as in (14.5), we
see that different data points within the data set can potentially be generated from
different values of the latent variable z and hence by different components.
Although we have considered the marginal probability p(X), the same consid-
erations apply for the predictive density p(x|X) or for conditional distributions such
as p(t|x, X, T).

Exercise 14.1

14.2. Committees

Section 3.2

The simplest way to construct a committee is to average the predictions of a set of
individual models. Such a procedure can be motivated from a frequentist perspective
by considering the trade-off between bias and variance, which decomposes the er-
ror due to a model into the bias component that arises from differences between the
model and the true function to be predicted, and the variance component that repre-
sents the sensitivity of the model to the individual data points. Recall from Figure 3.5

656

14. COMBINING MODELS

that when we trained multiple polynomials using the sinusoidal data, and then aver-
aged the resulting functions, the contribution arising from the variance term tended to
cancel, leading to improved predictions. When we averaged a set of low-bias mod-
els (corresponding to higher order polynomials), we obtained accurate predictions
for the underlying sinusoidal function from which the data were generated.

In practice, of course, we have only a single data set, and so we have to ﬁnd
a way to introduce variability between the different models within the committee.
One approach is to use bootstrap data sets, discussed in Section 1.2.3. Consider a
regression problem in which we are trying to predict the value of a single continuous
variable, and suppose we generate M bootstrap data sets and then use each to train
a separate copy ym(x) of a predictive model where m = 1, . . . , M. The committee
prediction is given by

ym(x).

(14.7)

M(cid:2)

m=1

yCOM(x) =

M

This procedure is known as bootstrap aggregation or bagging (Breiman, 1996).

Suppose the true regression function that we are trying to predict is given by
h(x), so that the output of each of the models can be written as the true value plus
an error in the form

ym(x) = h(x) + m(x).

(14.8)

The average sum-of-squares error then takes the form

Ex

(14.9)
where Ex[·] denotes a frequentist expectation with respect to the distribution of the
input vector x. The average error made by the models acting individually is therefore

(14.14)

This apparently dramatic result suggests that the average error of a model can be
reduced by a factor of M simply by averaging M versions of the model. Unfortu-
nately, it depends on the key assumption that the errors due to the individual models
are uncorrelated. In practice, the errors are typically highly correlated, and the reduc-
tion in overall error is generally small. It can, however, be shown that the expected
committee error will not exceed the expected error of the constituent models, so that

sophisticated technique for building committees, known as boosting.

Exercise 14.3

14.3. Boosting

Boosting is a powerful technique for combining multiple ‘base’ classiﬁers to produce
a form of committee whose performance can be signiﬁcantly better than that of any
of the base classiﬁers. Here we describe the most widely used form of boosting
algorithm called AdaBoost, short for ‘adaptive boosting’, developed by Freund and
Schapire (1996). Boosting can give good results even if the base classiﬁers have a
performance that is only slightly better than random, and hence sometimes the base
classiﬁers are known as weak learners. Originally designed for solving classiﬁcation
problems, boosting can also be extended to regression (Friedman, 2001).

The principal difference between boosting and the committee methods such as
bagging discussed above, is that the base classiﬁers are trained in sequence, and
each base classiﬁer is trained using a weighted form of the data set in which the
weighting coefﬁcient associated with each data point depends on the performance
of the previous classiﬁers. In particular, points that are misclassiﬁed by one of the
base classiﬁers are given greater weight when used to train the next classiﬁer in
the sequence. Once all the classiﬁers have been trained, their predictions are then
combined through a weighted majority voting scheme, as illustrated schematically
in Figure 14.1.

Consider a two-class classiﬁcation problem, in which the training data comprises
input vectors x1, . . . , xN along with corresponding binary target variables t1, . . . , tN
where tn ∈ {−1, 1}. Each data point is given an associated weighting parameter
wn, which is initially set 1/N for all data points. We shall suppose that we have
a procedure available for training a base classiﬁer using weighted data to give a
function y(x) ∈ {−1, 1}. At each stage of the algorithm, AdaBoost trains a new
classiﬁer using a data set in which the weighting coefﬁcients are adjusted according
to the performance of the previously trained classiﬁer so as to give greater weight
to the misclassiﬁed data points. Finally, when the desired number of base classiﬁers
have been trained, they are combined to form a committee using coefﬁcients that
give different weight to different base classiﬁers. The precise form of the AdaBoost
algorithm is given below.

We see that the ﬁrst base classiﬁer y1(x) is trained using weighting coefﬁ-
(1)
n that are all equal, which therefore corresponds to the usual procedure
cients w
for training a single classiﬁer. From (14.18), we see that in subsequent iterations
(m)
the weighting coefﬁcients w
are increased for data points that are misclassiﬁed
n
and decreased for data points that are correctly classiﬁed. Successive classiﬁers are
therefore forced to place greater emphasis on points that have been misclassiﬁed by
previous classiﬁers, and data points that continue to be misclassiﬁed by successive
classiﬁers receive ever greater weight. The quantities m represent weighted mea-
sures of the error rates of each of the base classiﬁers on the data set. We therefore
see that the weighting coefﬁcients αm deﬁned by (14.17) give greater weight to the
more accurate classiﬁers when computing the overall output given by (14.19).

The AdaBoost algorithm is illustrated in Figure 14.2, using a subset of 30 data
points taken from the toy classiﬁcation data set shown in Figure A.7. Here each base
learners consists of a threshold on one of the input variables. This simple classiﬁer
corresponds to a form of decision tree known as a ‘decision stumps’, i.e., a deci-
sion tree with a single node. Thus each base learner classiﬁes an input according to
whether one of the input features exceeds some threshold and therefore simply parti-
tions the space into two regions separated by a linear decision surface that is parallel
to one of the axes.

Section 14.4

14.3.1 Minimizing exponential error
Boosting was originally motivated using statistical learning theory, leading to
upper bounds on the generalization error. However, these bounds turn out to be too
loose to have practical value, and the actual performance of boosting is much better
than the bounds alone would suggest. Friedman et al. (2000) gave a different and
very simple interpretation of boosting in terms of the sequential minimization of an
exponential error function.

Consider the exponential error function deﬁned by
exp{−tnfm(xn)}

E =

where fm(x) is a classiﬁer deﬁned in terms of a linear combination of base classiﬁers

and tn ∈ {−1, 1} are the training set target values. Our goal is to minimize E with
respect to both the weighting coefﬁcients αl and the parameters of the base classiﬁers
yl(x).

boundary of the most recent base learner (dashed black line) and the combined decision boundary of the en-
semble (solid green line). Each data point is depicted by a circle whose radius indicates the weight assigned to
that data point when training the most recently added base learner. Thus, for instance, we see that points that
are misclassiﬁed by the m = 1 base learner are given greater weight when training the m = 2 base learner.

Instead of doing a global error function minimization, however, we shall sup-
pose that the base classiﬁers y1(x), . . . , ym−1(x) are ﬁxed, as are their coefﬁcients
α1, . . . , αm−1, and so we are minimizing only with respect to αm and ym(x). Sep-
arating off the contribution from base classiﬁer ym(x), we can then write the error

When we minimize this with respect to ym(x), we see that the second term is con-
stant, and so this is equivalent to minimizing (14.15) because the overall multiplica-
tive factor in front of the summation does not affect the location of the minimum.
Similarly, minimizing with respect to αm, we obtain (14.17) in which m is deﬁned
by (14.16).

From (14.22) we see that, having found αm and ym(x), the weights on the data

Because the term exp(−αm/2) is independent of n, we see that it weights all data

Finally, once all the base classiﬁers are trained, new data points are classiﬁed by
evaluating the sign of the combined function deﬁned according to (14.21). Because
the factor of 1/2 does not affect the sign it can be omitted, giving (14.19).

14.3.2 Error functions for boosting
The exponential error function that is minimized by the AdaBoost algorithm
differs from those considered in previous chapters. To gain some insight into the
nature of the exponential error function, we ﬁrst consider the expected error given
by

which is half the log-odds. Thus the AdaBoost algorithm is seeking the best approx-
imation to the log odds ratio, within the space of functions represented by the linear
combination of base classiﬁers, subject to the constrained minimization resulting
from the sequential optimization strategy. This result motivates the use of the sign
function in (14.19) to arrive at the ﬁnal classiﬁcation decision.

We have already seen that the minimizer y(x) of the cross-entropy error (4.90)
for two-class classiﬁcation is given by the posterior class probability. In the case
of a target variable t ∈ {−1, 1}, we have seen that the error function is given by
ln(1 + exp(−yt)). This is compared with the exponential error function in Fig-
ure 14.3, where we have divided the cross-entropy error by a constant factor ln(2)
so that it passes through the point (0, 1) for ease of comparison. We see that both
can be seen as continuous approximations to the ideal misclassiﬁcation error func-
tion. An advantage of the exponential error is that its sequential minimization leads
to the simple AdaBoost scheme. One drawback, however, is that it penalizes large
negative values of ty(x) much more strongly than cross-entropy. In particular, we
see that for large negative values of ty, the cross-entropy grows linearly with |ty|,
whereas the exponential error function grows exponentially with |ty|. Thus the ex-
ponential error function will be much less robust to outliers or misclassiﬁed data
points. Another important difference between cross-entropy and the exponential er-
ror function is that the latter cannot be interpreted as the log likelihood function of
any well-deﬁned probabilistic model. Furthermore, the exponential error does not
generalize to classiﬁcation problems having K > 2 classes, again in contrast to the
cross-entropy for a probabilistic model, which is easily generalized to give (4.108).
The interpretation of boosting as the sequential optimization of an additive model
under an exponential error (Friedman et al., 2000) opens the door to a wide range
of boosting-like algorithms, including multiclass extensions, by altering the choice
of error function. It also motivates the extension to regression problems (Friedman,
2001). If we consider a sum-of-squares error function for regression, then sequential
minimization of an additive model of the form (14.21) simply involves ﬁtting each
new base classiﬁer to the residual errors tn−fm−1(xn) from the previous model. As
we have noted, however, the sum-of-squares error is not robust to outliers, and this

can be addressed by basing the boosting algorithm on the absolute deviation |y − t|
instead. These two error functions are compared in Figure 14.4.

14.4. Tree-based Models

There are various simple, but widely used, models that work by partitioning the
input space into cuboid regions, whose edges are aligned with the axes, and then
assigning a simple model (for example, a constant) to each region. They can be
viewed as a model combination method in which only one model is responsible
for making predictions at any given point in input space. The process of selecting
a speciﬁc model, given a new input x, can be described by a sequential decision
making process corresponding to the traversal of a binary tree (one that splits into
two branches at each node). Here we focus on a particular tree-based framework
called classiﬁcation and regression trees, or CART (Breiman et al., 1984), although
there are many other variants going by such names as ID3 and C4.5 (Quinlan, 1986;
Quinlan, 1993).

Figure 14.5 shows an illustration of a recursive binary partitioning of the input
space, along with the corresponding tree structure. In this example, the ﬁrst step

divides the whole of the input space into two regions according to whether x1 (cid:1) θ1
or x1 > θ1 where θ1 is a parameter of the model. This creates two subregions, each
of which can then be subdivided independently. For instance, the region x1 (cid:1) θ1
is further subdivided according to whether x2 (cid:1) θ2 or x2 > θ2, giving rise to the
regions denoted A and B. The recursive subdivision can be described by the traversal
of the binary tree shown in Figure 14.6. For any new input x, we determine which
region it falls into by starting at the top of the tree at the root node and following
a path down to a speciﬁc leaf node according to the decision criteria at each node.
Note that such decision trees are not probabilistic graphical models.

Within each region, there is a separate model to predict the target variable. For
instance, in regression we might simply predict a constant over each region, or in
classiﬁcation we might assign each region to a speciﬁc class. A key property of tree-
based models, which makes them popular in ﬁelds such as medical diagnosis, for
example, is that they are readily interpretable by humans because they correspond
to a sequence of binary decisions applied to the individual input variables. For in-
stance, to predict a patient’s disease, we might ﬁrst ask “is their temperature greater
than some threshold?”. If the answer is yes, then we might next ask “is their blood
pressure less than some threshold?”. Each leaf of the tree is then associated with a
speciﬁc diagnosis.

In order to learn such a model from a training set, we have to determine the
structure of the tree, including which input variable is chosen at each node to form
the split criterion as well as the value of the threshold parameter θi for the split. We
also have to determine the values of the predictive variable within each region.

Consider ﬁrst a regression problem in which the goal is to predict a single target
variable t from a D-dimensional vector x = (x1, . . . , xD)T of input variables. The
training data consists of input vectors {x1, . . . , xN} along with the corresponding
continuous labels {t1, . . . , tN}. If the partitioning of the input space is given, and we
minimize the sum-of-squares error function, then the optimal value of the predictive
variable within any given region is just given by the average of the values of tn for
those data points that fall in that region.

Now consider how to determine the structure of the decision tree. Even for a
ﬁxed number of nodes in the tree, the problem of determining the optimal structure
(including choice of input variable for each split as well as the corresponding thresh-

Exercise 14.10

14.4. Tree-based Models

665

olds) to minimize the sum-of-squares error is usually computationally infeasible due
to the combinatorially large number of possible solutions. Instead, a greedy opti-
mization is generally done by starting with a single root node, corresponding to the
whole input space, and then growing the tree by adding nodes one at a time. At each
step there will be some number of candidate regions in input space that can be split,
corresponding to the addition of a pair of leaf nodes to the existing tree. For each
of these, there is a choice of which of the D input variables to split, as well as the
value of the threshold. The joint optimization of the choice of region to split, and the
choice of input variable and threshold, can be done efﬁciently by exhaustive search
noting that, for a given choice of split variable and threshold, the optimal choice of
predictive variable is given by the local average of the data, as noted earlier. This
is repeated for all possible choices of variable to be split, and the one that gives the
smallest residual sum-of-squares error is retained.

Given a greedy strategy for growing the tree, there remains the issue of when
to stop adding nodes. A simple approach would be to stop when the reduction in
residual error falls below some threshold. However, it is found empirically that often
none of the available splits produces a signiﬁcant reduction in error, and yet after
several more splits a substantial error reduction is found. For this reason, it is com-
mon practice to grow a large tree, using a stopping criterion based on the number
of data points associated with the leaf nodes, and then prune back the resulting tree.
The pruning is based on a criterion that balances residual error against a measure of
model complexity. If we denote the starting tree for pruning by T0, then we deﬁne
T ⊂ T0 to be a subtree of T0 if it can be obtained by pruning nodes from T0 (in
other words, by collapsing internal nodes by combining the corresponding regions).
Suppose the leaf nodes are indexed by τ = 1, . . . ,|T|, with leaf node τ representing
a region Rτ of input space having Nτ data points, and |T| denoting the total number
of leaf nodes. The optimal prediction for region Rτ is then given by

yτ =

tn

(14.29)

and the corresponding contribution to the residual sum-of-squares is then

The pruning criterion is then given by

The regularization parameter λ determines the trade-off between the overall residual
sum-of-squares error and the complexity of the model as measured by the number
|T| of leaf nodes, and its value is chosen by cross-validation.

For classiﬁcation problems, the process of growing and pruning the tree is sim-
ilar, except that the sum-of-squares error is replaced by a more appropriate measure

encourage the formation of regions in which a high proportion of the data points are
assigned to one class. The cross entropy and the Gini index are better measures than
the misclassiﬁcation rate for growing the tree because they are more sensitive to the
node probabilities. Also, unlike misclassiﬁcation rate, they are differentiable and
hence better suited to gradient based optimization methods. For subsequent pruning
of the tree, the misclassiﬁcation rate is generally used.

The human interpretability of a tree model such as CART is often seen as its
major strength. However, in practice it is found that the particular tree structure that
is learned is very sensitive to the details of the data set, so that a small change to the
training data can result in a very different set of splits (Hastie et al., 2001).

There are other problems with tree-based methods of the kind considered in
this section. One is that the splits are aligned with the axes of the feature space,
which may be very suboptimal. For instance, to separate two classes whose optimal
decision boundary runs at 45 degrees to the axes would need a large number of
axis-parallel splits of the input space as compared to a single non-axis-aligned split.
Furthermore, the splits in a decision tree are hard, so that each region of input space
is associated with one, and only one, leaf node model. The last issue is particularly
problematic in regression where we are typically aiming to model smooth functions,
and yet the tree model produces piecewise-constant predictions with discontinuities
at the split boundaries.

14.5. Conditional Mixture Models

We have seen that standard decision trees are restricted by hard, axis-aligned splits of
the input space. These constraints can be relaxed, at the expense of interpretability,
by allowing soft, probabilistic splits that can be functions of all of the input variables,
not just one of them at a time. If we also give the leaf models a probabilistic inter-
pretation, we arrive at a fully probabilistic tree-based model called the hierarchical
mixture of experts, which we consider in Section 14.5.3.

An alternative way to motivate the hierarchical mixture of experts model is to
start with a standard probabilistic mixtures of unconditional density models such as
Gaussians and replace the component densities with conditional distributions. Here
we consider mixtures of linear regression models (Section 14.5.1) and mixtures of

Chapter 9

14.5. Conditional Mixture Models

667

logistic regression models (Section 14.5.2). In the simplest case, the mixing coefﬁ-
cients are independent of the input variables. If we make a further generalization to
allow the mixing coefﬁcients also to depend on the inputs then we obtain a mixture
of experts model. Finally, if we allow each component in the mixture model to be
itself a mixture of experts model, then we obtain a hierarchical mixture of experts.

14.5.1 Mixtures of linear regression models
One of the many advantages of giving a probabilistic interpretation to the lin-
ear regression model is that it can then be used as a component in more complex
probabilistic models. This can be done, for instance, by viewing the conditional
distribution representing the linear regression model as a node in a directed prob-
abilistic graph. Here we consider a simple example corresponding to a mixture of
linear regression models, which represents a straightforward extension of the Gaus-
sian mixture model discussed in Section 9.2 to the case of conditional Gaussian
distributions.

We therefore consider K linear regression models, each governed by its own
weight parameter wk. In many applications, it will be appropriate to use a common
noise variance, governed by a precision parameter β, for all K components, and this
is the case we consider here. We will once again restrict attention to a single target
variable t, though the extension to multiple outputs is straightforward. If we denote
the mixing coefﬁcients by πk, then the mixture distribution can be written

p(t|θ) =

πkN (t|wT

k φ, β

−1)

(14.34)
where θ denotes the set of all adaptive parameters in the model, namely W = {wk},
(cid:22)
π = {πk}, and β. The log likelihood function for this model, given a data set of
K(cid:2)
observations {φn, tn}, then takes the form

(14.35)

K(cid:2)

where t = (t1, . . . , tN)T denotes the vector of target variables.

n=1

k=1

In order to maximize this likelihood function, we can once again appeal to the
EM algorithm, which will turn out to be a simple extension of the EM algorithm for
unconditional Gaussian mixtures of Section 9.2. We can therefore build on our expe-
rience with the unconditional mixture and introduce a set Z = {zn} of binary latent
variables where znk ∈ {0, 1} in which, for each data point n, all of the elements
k = 1, . . . , K are zero except for a single value of 1 indicating which component
of the mixture was responsible for generating that data point. The joint distribution
over latent and observed variables can be represented by the graphical model shown
in Figure 14.7.

The complete-data log likelihood function then takes the form

The EM algorithm begins by ﬁrst choosing an initial value θold for the model param-

γnk ﬁxed. For the optimization with respect to the mixing coefﬁcients πk we need
k πk = 1, which can be done with the aid of a

Note that this has exactly the same form as the corresponding result for a simple

Next consider the maximization with respect to the parameter vector wk of the

the function Q(θ, θold), as a function of the parameter vector wk, takes the form

the inclusion of the responsibilities γnk. This represents a weighted least squares

problem, in which the term corresponding to the nth data point carries a weighting
coefﬁcient given by βγnk, which could be interpreted as an effective precision for
each data point. We see that each component linear regression model in the mixture,
governed by its own parameter vector wk, is ﬁtted separately to the whole data set in
the M step, but with each data point n weighted by the responsibility γnk that model
k takes for that data point. Setting the derivative of (14.39) with respect to wk equal

This represents a set of modiﬁed normal equations corresponding to the weighted
least squares problem, of the same form as (4.99) found in the context of logistic
regression. Note that after each E step, the matrix Rk will change and so we will
have to solve the normal equations afresh in the subsequent M step.

Finally, we maximize Q(θ, θold) with respect to β. Keeping only terms that

In Figure 14.8, we illustrate this EM algorithm using the simple example of
ﬁtting a mixture of two straight lines to a data set having one input variable x and
one target variable t. The predictive density (14.34) is plotted in Figure 14.9 using
the converged parameter values obtained from the EM algorithm, corresponding to
the right-hand plot in Figure 14.8. Also shown in this ﬁgure is the result of ﬁtting
a single linear regression model, which gives a unimodal predictive density. We see
that the mixture model gives a much better representation of the data distribution,
and this is reﬂected in the higher likelihood value. However, the mixture model
also assigns signiﬁcant probability mass to regions where there is no data because its
predictive distribution is bimodal for all values of x. This problem can be resolved by
extending the model to allow the mixture coefﬁcients themselves to be functions of
x, leading to models such as the mixture density networks discussed in Section 5.6,
and hierarchical mixture of experts discussed in Section 14.5.3.

Figure 14.8 Example of a synthetic data set, shown by the green points, having one input variable x and one
target variable t, together with a mixture of two linear regression models whose mean functions y(x, wk), where
k ∈ {1, 2}, are shown by the blue and red lines. The upper three plots show the initial conﬁguration (left), the
result of running 30 iterations of EM (centre), and the result after 50 iterations of EM (right). Here β was initialized
to the reciprocal of the true variance of the set of target values. The lower three plots show the corresponding
responsibilities plotted as a vertical line for each data point in which the length of the blue segment gives the
posterior probability of the blue line for that data point (and similarly for the red segment).

14.5.2 Mixtures of logistic models
Because the logistic regression model deﬁnes a conditional distribution for the
target variable, given the input vector, it is straightforward to use it as the component
distribution in a mixture model, thereby giving rise to a richer family of conditional
distributions compared to a single logistic regression model. This example involves
a straightforward combination of ideas encountered in earlier sections of the book
and will help consolidate these for the reader.

The conditional distribution of the target variable, for a probabilistic mixture of

K logistic regression models, is given by

value of x represents the corresponding conditional distribution p(t|x), which we see is bimodal. The plot on the

likelihood. This model has a smaller log likelihood of −27.6.

where ynk = σ(wT

function iteratively by making use of the EM algorithm. This involves introducing
latent variables znk that correspond to a 1-of-K coded binary indicator variable for
each data point n. The complete-data likelihood function is then given by

p(t, Z|θ) =

πkytn

nk [1 − ynk]1−tn

(14.47)

where Z is the matrix of latent variables with elements znk. We initialize the EM

we then use these parameter values to evaluate the posterior probabilities of the com-
ponents k for each data point n, which are given by

The M step involves maximization of this function with respect to θ, keeping θold,
and hence γnk, ﬁxed. Maximization with respect to πk can be done in the usual way,
k πk = 1, giving
with a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the summation constraint
the familiar result

πk =

n=1

γnk.

(14.50)
To determine the {wk}, we note that the Q(θ, θold) function comprises a sum
over terms indexed by k each of which depends only on one of the vectors wk, so
that the different vectors are decoupled in the M step of the EM algorithm. In other
words, the different components interact only via the responsibilities, which are ﬁxed
during the M step. Note that the M step does not have a closed-form solution and
must be solved iteratively using, for instance, the iterative reweighted least squares
(IRLS) algorithm. The gradient and the Hessian for the vector wk are given by

where ∇k denotes the gradient with respect to wk. For ﬁxed γnk, these are indepen-
dent of {wj} for j (cid:9)= k and so we can solve for each wk separately using the IRLS
algorithm. Thus the M-step equations for component k correspond simply to ﬁtting
a single logistic regression model to a weighted data set in which data point n carries
a weight γnk. Figure 14.10 shows an example of the mixture of logistic regression
models applied to a simple classiﬁcation problem. The extension of this model to a
mixture of softmax models for more than two classes is straightforward.

14.5.3 Mixtures of experts
In Section 14.5.1, we considered a mixture of linear regression models, and in
Section 14.5.2 we discussed the analogous mixture of linear classiﬁers. Although
these simple mixtures extend the ﬂexibility of linear models to include more com-
plex (e.g., multimodal) predictive distributions, they are still very limited. We can
further increase the capability of such models by allowing the mixing coefﬁcients
themselves to be functions of the input variable, so that

p(t|x) =

πk(x)pk(t|x).

(14.53)

k=1

This is known as a mixture of experts model (Jacobs et al., 1991) in which the mix-
ing coefﬁcients πk(x) are known as gating functions and the individual component
densities pk(t|x) are called experts. The notion behind the terminology is that differ-
ent components can model the distribution in different regions of input space (they

from two classes denoted red and blue, in which the background colour (which varies from pure red to pure blue)
denotes the true probability of the class label. The centre plot shows the result of ﬁtting a single logistic regression
model using maximum likelihood, in which the background colour denotes the corresponding probability of the
class label. Because the colour is a near-uniform purple, we see that the model assigns a probability of around
0.5 to each of the classes over most of input space. The right plot shows the result of ﬁtting a mixture of two
logistic regression models, which now gives much higher probability to the correct labels for many of the points
in the blue class.

are ‘experts’ at making predictions in their own regions), and the gating functions
determine which components are dominant in which region.
The gating functions πk(x) must satisfy the usual constraints for mixing co-
efﬁcients, namely 0 (cid:1) πk(x) (cid:1) 1 and
k πk(x) = 1. They can therefore be
represented, for example, by linear softmax models of the form (4.104) and (4.105).
If the experts are also linear (regression or classiﬁcation) models, then the whole
model can be ﬁtted efﬁciently using the EM algorithm, with iterative reweighted
least squares being employed in the M step (Jordan and Jacobs, 1994).

Such a model still has signiﬁcant limitations due to the use of linear models
for the gating and expert functions. A much more ﬂexible model is obtained by
using a multilevel gating function to give the hierarchical mixture of experts, or
HME model (Jordan and Jacobs, 1994). To understand the structure of this model,
imagine a mixture distribution in which each component in the mixture is itself a
mixture distribution. For simple unconditional mixtures, this hierarchical mixture is
trivially equivalent to a single ﬂat mixture distribution. However, when the mixing
coefﬁcients are input dependent, this hierarchical model becomes nontrivial. The
HME model can also be viewed as a probabilistic version of decision trees discussed
in Section 14.4 and can again be trained efﬁciently by maximum likelihood using an
EM algorithm with IRLS in the M step. A Bayesian treatment of the HME has been
given by Bishop and Svens´en (2003) based on variational inference.

We shall not discuss the HME in detail here. However, it is worth pointing out
the close connection with the mixture density network discussed in Section 5.6. The
principal advantage of the mixtures of experts model is that it can be optimized by
EM in which the M step for each mixture component and gating model involves
a convex optimization (although the overall optimization is nonconvex). By con-
trast, the advantage of the mixture density network approach is that the component

densities and the mixing coefﬁcients share the hidden units of the neural network.
Furthermore, in the mixture density network, the splits of the input space are further
relaxed compared to the hierarchical mixture of experts in that they are not only soft,
and not constrained to be axis aligned, but they can also be nonlinear.

models. Show that the hierarchical mixture cannot in general be represented by a
single-level mixture having linear classiﬁcation models for the mixing coefﬁcients.
Hint: to do this it is sufﬁcient to construct a single counter-example, so consider a
mixture of two components in which one of those components is itself a mixture of
two components, with mixing coefﬁcients given by linear-logistic models. Show that
this cannot be represented by a single-level mixture of 3 components having mixing
coefﬁcients determined by a linear-softmax model.

Appendix A. Data Sets

In this appendix, we give a brief introduction to the data sets used to illustrate some
of the algorithms described in this book. Detailed information on ﬁle formats for
these data sets, as well as the data ﬁles themselves, can be obtained from the book
web site:

Handwritten Digits

The digits data used in this book is taken from the MNIST data set (LeCun et al.,
1998), which itself was constructed by modifying a subset of the much larger data
set produced by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology). It com-
prises a training set of 60, 000 examples and a test set of 10, 000 examples. Some
of the data was collected from Census Bureau employees and the rest was collected
from high-school children, and care was taken to ensure that the test examples were
written by different individuals to the training examples.
The original NIST data had binary (black or white) pixels. To create MNIST,
these images were size normalized to ﬁt in a 20×20 pixel box while preserving their
aspect ratio. As a consequence of the anti-aliasing used to change the resolution of
the images, the resulting MNIST digits are grey scale. These images were then
centred in a 28 × 28 box. Examples of the MNIST digits are shown in Figure A.1.
Error rates for classifying the digits range from 12% for a simple linear classi-
ﬁer, through 0.56% for a carefully designed support vector machine, to 0.4% for a
convolutional neural network (LeCun et al., 1998).

Oil Flow

This is a synthetic data set that arose out of a project aimed at measuring nonin-
vasively the proportions of oil, water, and gas in North Sea oil transfer pipelines
(Bishop and James, 1993). It is based on the principle of dual-energy gamma densit-
ometry. The ideas is that if a narrow beam of gamma rays is passed through the pipe,
the attenuation in the intensity of the beam provides information about the density of
material along its path. Thus, for instance, the beam will be attenuated more strongly
by oil than by gas.

A single attenuation measurement alone is not sufﬁcient because there are two
degrees of freedom corresponding to the fraction of oil and the fraction of water (the
fraction of gas is redundant because the three fractions must add to one). To address
this, two gamma beams of different energies (in other words different frequencies or
wavelengths) are passed through the pipe along the same path, and the attenuation of
each is measured. Because the absorbtion properties of different materials vary dif-
ferently as a function of energy, measurement of the attenuations at the two energies
provides two independent pieces of information. Given the known absorbtion prop-
erties of oil, water, and gas at the two energies, it is then a simple matter to calculate
the average fractions of oil and water (and hence of gas) measured along the path of
the gamma beams.

There is a further complication, however, associated with the motion of the ma-
terials along the pipe. If the ﬂow velocity is small, then the oil ﬂoats on top of the
water with the gas sitting above the oil. This is known as a laminar or stratiﬁed

Figure A.2 The three geometrical conﬁgurations of the oil,
water, and gas phases used to generate the oil-
ﬂow data set. For each conﬁguration, the pro-
portions of the three phases can vary.

ﬂow conﬁguration and is illustrated in Figure A.2. As the ﬂow velocity is increased,
more complex geometrical conﬁgurations of the oil, water, and gas can arise. For the
purposes of this data set, two speciﬁc idealizations are considered. In the annular
conﬁguration the oil, water, and gas form concentric cylinders with the water around
the outside and the gas in the centre, whereas in the homogeneous conﬁguration the
oil, water and gas are assumed to be intimately mixed as might occur at high ﬂow
velocities under turbulent conditions. These conﬁgurations are also illustrated in
Figure A.2.

We have seen that a single dual-energy beam gives the oil and water fractions
measured along the path length, whereas we are interested in the volume fractions of
oil and water. This can be addressed by using multiple dual-energy gamma densit-
ometers whose beams pass through different regions of the pipe. For this particular
data set, there are six such beams, and their spatial arrangement is shown in Fig-
ure A.3. A single observation is therefore represented by a 12-dimensional vector
comprising the fractions of oil and water measured along the paths of each of the
beams. We are, however, interested in obtaining the overall volume fractions of the
three phases in the pipe. This is much like the classical problem of tomographic re-
construction, used in medical imaging for example, in which a two-dimensional dis-

tribution is to be reconstructed from an number of one-dimensional averages. Here
there are far fewer line measurements than in a typical tomography application. On
the other hand the range of geometrical conﬁgurations is much more limited, and so
the conﬁguration, as well as the phase fractions, can be predicted with reasonable
accuracy from the densitometer data.

For safety reasons, the intensity of the gamma beams is kept relatively weak and
so to obtain an accurate measurement of the attenuation, the measured beam intensity
is integrated over a speciﬁc time interval. For a ﬁnite integration time, there are
random ﬂuctuations in the measured intensity due to the fact that the gamma beams
comprise discrete packets of energy called photons. In practice, the integration time
is chosen as a compromise between reducing the noise level (which requires a long
integration time) and detecting temporal variations in the ﬂow (which requires a short
integration time). The oil ﬂow data set is generated using realistic known values for
the absorption properties of oil, water, and gas at the two gamma energies used, and
with a speciﬁc choice of integration time (10 seconds) chosen as characteristic of a
typical practical setup.

Each point in the data set is generated independently using the following steps:

1. Choose one of the three phase conﬁgurations at random with equal probability.

2. Choose three random numbers f1, f2 and f3 from the uniform distribution over

(0, 1) and deﬁne

foil =

f1

f1 + f2 + f3

,

fwater =

f2

f1 + f2 + f3

.

(A.1)

This treats the three phases on an equal footing and ensures that the volume
fractions add to one.

3. For each of the six beam lines, calculate the effective path lengths through oil

and water for the given phase conﬁguration.

4. Perturb the path lengths using the Poisson distribution based on the known
beam intensities and integration time to allow for the effect of photon statistics.

Each point in the data set comprises the 12 path length measurements, together
with the fractions of oil and water and a binary label describing the phase conﬁgu-
ration. The data set is divided into training, validation, and test sets, each of which
comprises 1, 000 independent data points. Details of the data format are available
from the book web site.

In Bishop and James (1993), statistical machine learning techniques were used
to predict the volume fractions and also the geometrical conﬁguration of the phases
shown in Figure A.2, from the 12-dimensional vector of measurements. The 12-
dimensional observation vectors can also be used to test data visualization algo-
rithms.

This data set has a rich and interesting structure, as follows. For any given
conﬁguration there are two degrees of freedom corresponding to the fractions of

A. DATA SETS

681

oil and water, and so for inﬁnite integration time the data will locally live on a two-
dimensional manifold. For a ﬁnite integration time, the individual data points will be
perturbed away from the manifold by the photon noise. In the homogeneous phase
conﬁguration, the path lengths in oil and water are linearly related to the fractions of
oil and water, and so the data points lie close to a linear manifold. For the annular
conﬁguration, the relationship between phase fraction and path length is nonlinear
and so the manifold will be nonlinear. In the case of the laminar conﬁguration the
situation is even more complex because small variations in the phase fractions can
cause one of the horizontal phase boundaries to move across one of the horizontal
beam lines leading to a discontinuous jump in the 12-dimensional observation space.
In this way, the two-dimensional nonlinear manifold for the laminar conﬁguration is
broken into six distinct segments. Note also that some of the manifolds for different
phase conﬁgurations meet at speciﬁc points, for example if the pipe is ﬁlled entirely
with oil, it corresponds to speciﬁc instances of the laminar, annular, and homoge-
neous conﬁgurations.

Old Faithful

Old Faithful, shown in Figure A.4, is a hydrothermal geyser in Yellowstone National
Park in the state of Wyoming, U.S.A., and is a popular tourist attraction. Its name
stems from the supposed regularity of its eruptions.

The data set comprises 272 observations, each of which represents a single erup-
tion and contains two variables corresponding to the duration in minutes of the erup-
tion, and the time until the next eruption, also in minutes. Figure A.5 shows a plot of
the time to the next eruption versus the duration of the eruptions. It can be seen that
the time to the next eruption varies considerably, although knowledge of the duration
of the current eruption allows it to be predicted more accurately. Note that there exist
several other data sets relating to the eruptions of Old Faithful.

Synthetic Data

Throughout the book, we use two simple synthetic data sets to illustrate many of the
algorithms. The ﬁrst of these is a regression problem, based on the sinusoidal func-
tion, shown in Figure A.6. The input values {xn} are generated uniformly in range
(0, 1), and the corresponding target values {tn} are obtained by ﬁrst computing the
corresponding values of the function sin(2πx), and then adding random noise with
a Gaussian distribution having standard deviation 0.3. Various forms of this data set,
having different numbers of data points, are used in the book.

The second data set is a classiﬁcation problem having two classes, with equal
prior probabilities, and is shown in Figure A.7. The blue class is generated from a
single Gaussian while the red class comes from a mixture of two Gaussians. Be-
cause we know the class priors and the class-conditional densities, it is straightfor-
ward to evaluate and plot the true posterior probabilities as well as the minimum
misclassiﬁcation-rate decision boundary, as shown in Figure A.7.

these probabilities are known, the optimal decision boundary for minimizing the misclassiﬁcation rate (which
corresponds to the contour along which the posterior probabilities for each class equal 0.5) can be evaluated
and is shown by the green curve. This decision boundary is also plotted on the left-hand ﬁgure.

Appendix B. Probability Distributions

In this appendix, we summarize the main properties of some of the most widely used
probability distributions, and for each distribution we list some key statistics such as
the expectation E[x], the variance (or covariance), the mode, and the entropy H[x].
All of these distributions are members of the exponential family and are widely used
as building blocks for more sophisticated probabilistic models.

Bernoulli
This is the distribution for a single binary variable x ∈ {0, 1} representing, for
example, the result of ﬂipping a coin. It is governed by a single continuous parameter
µ ∈ [0, 1] that represents the probability of x = 1.

The Bernoulli is a special case of the binomial distribution for the case of a single
observation. Its conjugate prior for µ is the beta distribution.

B. PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

Beta
This is a distribution over a continuous variable µ ∈ [0, 1], which is often used to
represent the probability for some binary event. It is governed by two parameters a
and b that are constrained by a > 0 and b > 0 to ensure that the distribution can be
normalized.

(B.9)

The beta is the conjugate prior for the Bernoulli distribution, for which a and b can
be interpreted as the effective prior number of observations of x = 1 and x = 0,
respectively. Its density is ﬁnite if a (cid:2) 1 and b (cid:2) 1, otherwise there is a singularity
at µ = 0 and/or µ = 1. For a = b = 1, it reduces to a uniform distribution. The beta
distribution is a special case of the K-state Dirichlet distribution for K = 2.

Binomial

The binomial distribution gives the probability of observing m occurrences of x = 1
in a set of N samples from a Bernoulli distribution, where the probability of observ-
ing x = 1 is µ ∈ [0, 1].

. . . ,×2 × 1. The particular case of the binomial distribution for N = 1 is known as
the Bernoulli distribution, and for large N the binomial distribution is approximately
Gaussian. The conjugate prior for µ is the beta distribution.

αk are subject to the constraint αk > 0 in order to ensure that the distribution can be

The Dirichlet forms the conjugate prior for the multinomial distribution and rep-
resents a generalization of the beta distribution. In this case, the parameters αk can
be interpreted as effective numbers of observations of the corresponding values of
the K-dimensional binary observation vector x. As with the beta distribution, the
Dirichlet has ﬁnite density everywhere provided αk (cid:2) 1 for all k.

the conjugate prior for the precision (inverse variance) of a univariate Gaussian. For
a (cid:2) 1 the density is everywhere ﬁnite, and the special case of a = 1 is known as the
exponential distribution.

Gaussian

The Gaussian is the most widely used distribution for continuous variables. It is also
known as the normal distribution. In the case of a single variable x ∈ (−∞,∞) it is
governed by two parameters, the mean µ ∈ (−∞,∞) and the variance σ2 > 0.

are unknown, their joint conjugate prior is the Gaussian-gamma distribution.
For a D-dimensional vector x, the Gaussian is governed by a D-dimensional

The Gaussian is the distribution that maximizes the entropy for a given variance
(or covariance). Any linear transformation of a Gaussian random variable is again
Gaussian. The marginal distribution of a multivariate Gaussian with respect to a
subset of the variables is itself Gaussian, and similarly the conditional distribution is
also Gaussian. The conjugate prior for µ is the Gaussian, the conjugate prior for Λ
is the Wishart, and the conjugate prior for (µ, Λ) is the Gaussian-Wishart.

Dirichlet.

Normal

The normal distribution is simply another name for the Gaussian. In this book, we
use the term Gaussian throughout, although we retain the conventional use of the
symbol N to denote this distribution. For consistency, we shall refer to the normal-
gamma distribution as the Gaussian-gamma distribution, and similarly the normal-
Wishart is called the Gaussian-Wishart.

Student’s t

This distribution was published by William Gosset in 1908, but his employer, Gui-
ness Breweries, required him to publish under a pseudonym, so he chose ‘Student’.
In the univariate form, Student’s t-distribution is obtained by placing a conjugate
gamma prior over the precision of a univariate Gaussian distribution and then inte-
grating out the precision variable. It can therefore be viewed as an inﬁnite mixture

Von Mises

The von Mises distribution, also known as the circular normal or the circular Gaus-
sian, is a univariate Gaussian-like periodic distribution for a variable θ ∈ [0, 2π).

2πI0(m)

exp{m cos(θ − θ0)}

(B.77)

where I0(m) is the zeroth-order Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. The distribution
has period 2π so that p(θ + 2π) = p(θ) for all θ. Care must be taken in interpret-
ing this distribution because simple expectations will be dependent on the (arbitrary)
choice of origin for the variable θ. The parameter θ0 is analogous to the mean of a
univariate Gaussian, and the parameter m > 0, known as the concentration param-
eter, is analogous to the precision (inverse variance). For large m, the von Mises
distribution is approximately a Gaussian centred on θ0.

The Wishart distribution is the conjugate prior for the precision matrix of a multi-

Appendix C. Properties of Matrices

In this appendix, we gather together some useful properties and identities involving
matrices and determinants. This is not intended to be an introductory tutorial, and
it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with basic linear algebra. For some
results, we indicate how to prove them, whereas in more complex cases we leave
the interested reader to refer to standard textbooks on the subject. In all cases, we
assume that inverses exist and that matrix dimensions are such that the formulae
are correctly deﬁned. A comprehensive discussion of linear algebra can be found in
Golub and Van Loan (1996), and an extensive collection of matrix properties is given
by L¨utkepohl (1996). Matrix derivatives are discussed in Magnus and Neudecker
(1999).

Basic Matrix Identities

A matrix A has elements Aij where i indexes the rows, and j indexes the columns.
We use IN to denote the N × N identity matrix (also called the unit matrix), and
where there is no ambiguity over dimensionality we simply use I. The transpose
matrix AT has elements (AT)ij = Aji. From the deﬁnition of transpose, we have

(C.1)
which can be veriﬁed by writing out the indices. The inverse of A, denoted A−1,
satisﬁes

(AB)T = BTAT

AA−1 = A−1A = I.

Because ABB−1A−1 = I, we have

Also we have

(AB)−1 = B−1A−1.

C. PROPERTIES OF MATRICES

which is easily proven by taking the transpose of (C.2) and applying (C.1).

A useful identity involving matrix inverses is the following

(P−1 + BTR−1B)−1BTR−1 = PBT(BPBT + R)−1.

(C.5)

which is easily veriﬁed by right multiplying both sides by (BPBT + R). Suppose
that P has dimensionality N × N while R has dimensionality M × M, so that B is
M × N. Then if M (cid:5) N, it will be much cheaper to evaluate the right-hand side of
(C.5) than the left-hand side. A special case that sometimes arises is

(I + AB)−1A = A(I + BA)−1.

Another useful identity involving inverses is the following:

(A + BD−1C)−1 = A−1 − A−1B(D + CA−1B)−1CA−1

(C.6)

(C.7)

(cid:5)

which is known as the Woodbury identity and which can be veriﬁed by multiplying
both sides by (A + BD−1C). This is useful, for instance, when A is large and
diagonal, and hence easy to invert, while B has many rows but few columns (and
conversely for C) so that the right-hand side is much cheaper to evaluate than the
left-hand side.
A set of vectors {a1, . . . , aN} is said to be linearly independent if the relation
n αnan = 0 holds only if all αn = 0. This implies that none of the vectors
can be expressed as a linear combination of the remainder. The rank of a matrix is
the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or equivalently the maximum
number of linearly independent columns).

Traces and Determinants

Trace and determinant apply to square matrices. The trace Tr(A) of a matrix A
is deﬁned as the sum of the elements on the leading diagonal. By writing out the
indices, we see that

Tr(AB) = Tr(BA).

(C.8)

By applying this formula multiple times to the product of three matrices, we see that

Tr(ABC) = Tr(CAB) = Tr(BCA)

(C.9)

which is known as the cyclic property of the trace operator and which clearly extends
to the product of any number of matrices. The determinant |A| of an N × N matrix
A is deﬁned by

(cid:2)

|A| =

(±1)A1i1A2i2 ··· AN iN

(C.10)

in which the sum is taken over all products consisting of precisely one element from
each row and one element from each column, with a coefﬁcient +1 or −1 according

C. PROPERTIES OF MATRICES

697

to whether the permutation i1i2 . . . iN is even or odd, respectively. Note that |I| = 1.
Thus, for a 2 × 2 matrix, the determinant takes the form

(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7) a11 a12

a21 a22

(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7)(cid:7) = a11a22 − a12a21.

|A| =

The determinant of a product of two matrices is given by

which can again be proven by writing out the matrix indices. We also have

which follows from (C.22) and (C.26).

Eigenvector Equation
For a square matrix A of size M × M, the eigenvector equation is deﬁned by

Aui = λiui

(C.29)

C. PROPERTIES OF MATRICES

699

for i = 1, . . . , M, where ui is an eigenvector and λi is the corresponding eigenvalue.
This can be viewed as a set of M simultaneous homogeneous linear equations, and
the condition for a solution is that

|A − λiI| = 0

(C.30)

which is known as the characteristic equation. Because this is a polynomial of order
M in λi, it must have M solutions (though these need not all be distinct). The rank
of A is equal to the number of nonzero eigenvalues.

Of particular interest are symmetric matrices, which arise as covariance ma-
trices, kernel matrices, and Hessians. Symmetric matrices have the property that
Aij = Aji, or equivalently AT = A. The inverse of a symmetric matrix is also sym-
metric, as can be seen by taking the transpose of A−1A = I and using AA−1 = I
together with the symmetry of I.

In general, the eigenvalues of a matrix are complex numbers, but for symmetric
matrices the eigenvalues λi are real. This can be seen by ﬁrst left multiplying (C.29)
by (u(cid:3)

i )T, where (cid:11) denotes the complex conjugate, to give

(u(cid:3)

i )T Aui = λi (u(cid:3)

i )T ui.

(C.31)

Next we take the complex conjugate of (C.29) and left multiply by uT

i to give

i Au(cid:3)
uT

i = λ(cid:3)

i uT

i u(cid:3)
i .

(C.32)

where we have used A(cid:3) = A because we consider only real matrices A. Taking
the transpose of the second of these equations, and using AT = A, we see that the
left-hand sides of the two equations are equal, and hence that λ(cid:3)
i = λi and so λi
must be real.

The eigenvectors ui of a real symmetric matrix can be chosen to be orthonormal

(i.e., orthogonal and of unit length) so that

uT
i uj = Iij

(C.33)

where Iij are the elements of the identity matrix I. To show this, we ﬁrst left multiply
(C.29) by uT

j to give

and hence, by exchange of indices, we have

uT
j Aui = λiuT

j ui

uT
i Auj = λjuT

i uj.

(C.34)

(C.35)

We now take the transpose of the second equation and make use of the symmetry
property AT = A, and then subtract the two equations to give

(λi − λj) uT
Hence, for λi (cid:6)= λj, we have uT
i uj = 0, and hence ui and uj are orthogonal. If the
two eigenvalues are equal, then any linear combination αui + βuj is also an eigen-
vector with the same eigenvalue, so we can select one linear combination arbitrarily,

i uj = 0.

(C.36)

700

C. PROPERTIES OF MATRICES

and then choose the second to be orthogonal to the ﬁrst (it can be shown that the de-
generate eigenvectors are never linearly dependent). Hence the eigenvectors can be
chosen to be orthogonal, and by normalizing can be set to unit length. Because there
are M eigenvalues, the corresponding M orthogonal eigenvectors form a complete
set and so any M-dimensional vector can be expressed as a linear combination of
the eigenvectors.
We can take the eigenvectors ui to be the columns of an M × M matrix U,

which from orthonormality satisﬁes

UTU = I.

(C.37)

Such a matrix is said to be orthogonal. Interestingly, the rows of this matrix are also
orthogonal, so that UUT = I. To show this, note that (C.37) implies UTUU−1 =
U−1 = UT and so UU−1 = UUT = I. Using (C.12), it also follows that |U| = 1.

The eigenvector equation (C.29) can be expressed in terms of U in the form

(C.38)
where Λ is an M × M diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are given by the
eigenvalues λi.

AU = UΛ

If we consider a column vector x that is transformed by an orthogonal matrix U

to give a new vector

then the length of the vector is preserved because

and similarly the angle between any two such vectors is preserved because

(cid:4)x = Ux

(cid:4)xT(cid:4)x = xTUTUx = xTx
(cid:4)xT(cid:4)y = xTUTUy = xTy.

(C.39)

(C.40)

(C.41)

Thus, multiplication by U can be interpreted as a rigid rotation of the coordinate
system.

From (C.38), it follows that

UTAU = Λ

(C.42)

and because Λ is a diagonal matrix, we say that the matrix A is diagonalized by the
matrix U. If we left multiply by U and right multiply by UT, we obtain

(C.43)
Taking the inverse of this equation, and using (C.3) together with U−1 = UT, we
have

A = UΛUT

If we take the determinant of (C.43), and use (C.12), we obtain

(C.48)

We leave it as an exercise for the reader to verify (C.22) by making use of the results
(C.33), (C.45), (C.46), and (C.47).
A matrix A is said to be positive deﬁnite, denoted by A (cid:7) 0, if wTAw > 0 for
all values of the vector w. Equivalently, a positive deﬁnite matrix has λi > 0 for all
of its eigenvalues (as can be seen by setting w to each of the eigenvectors in turn,
and by noting that an arbitrary vector can be expanded as a linear combination of the
eigenvectors). Note that positive deﬁnite is not the same as all the elements being

positive. For example, the matrix (cid:15)

(cid:16)

(C.49)
has eigenvalues λ1 (cid:8) 5.37 and λ2 (cid:8) −0.37. A matrix is said to be positive semidef-
inite if wTAw (cid:2) 0 holds for all values of w, which is denoted A (cid:9) 0, and is
equivalent to λi (cid:2) 0.

Appendix D. Calculus of Variations

We can think of a function y(x) as being an operator that, for any input value x,
returns an output value y. In the same way, we can deﬁne a functional F [y] to be
an operator that takes a function y(x) and returns an output value F . An example of
a functional is the length of a curve drawn in a two-dimensional plane in which the
path of the curve is deﬁned in terms of a function. In the context of machine learning,
a widely used functional is the entropy H[x] for a continuous variable x because, for
any choice of probability density function p(x), it returns a scalar value representing
the entropy of x under that density. Thus the entropy of p(x) could equally well have
been written as H[p].

A common problem in conventional calculus is to ﬁnd a value of x that max-
imizes (or minimizes) a function y(x). Similarly, in the calculus of variations we
seek a function y(x) that maximizes (or minimizes) a functional F [y]. That is, of all
possible functions y(x), we wish to ﬁnd the particular function for which the func-
tional F [y] is a maximum (or minimum). The calculus of variations can be used, for
instance, to show that the shortest path between two points is a straight line or that
the maximum entropy distribution is a Gaussian.

If we weren’t familiar with the rules of ordinary calculus, we could evaluate a
conventional derivative dy/ dx by making a small change  to the variable x and
then expanding in powers of , so that

y(x + ) = y(x) +

(D.1)
and ﬁnally taking the limit  → 0. Similarly, for a function of several variables
y(x1, . . . , xD), the corresponding partial derivatives are deﬁned by

 + O(2)

y(x1 + 1, . . . , xD + D) = y(x1, . . . , xD) +

(D.2)

The analogous deﬁnition of a functional derivative arises when we consider how
much a functional F [y] changes when we make a small change η(x) to the function

703

704

D. CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS

Figure D.1 A functional derivative can be deﬁned by
considering how the value of a functional
F [y] changes when the function y(x) is
changed to y(x) + η(x) where η(x) is an
arbitrary function of x.

y(x)

y(x) + η(x)

x

y(x), where η(x) is an arbitrary function of x, as illustrated in Figure D.1. We denote
the functional derivative of E[f] with respect to f(x) by δF/δf(x), and deﬁne it by
the following relation:

(cid:6)

F [y(x) + η(x)] = F [y(x)] + 

δF
δy(x) η(x) dx + O(2).

(D.3)

This can be seen as a natural extension of (D.2) in which F [y] now depends on a
continuous set of variables, namely the values of y at all points x. Requiring that the
functional be stationary with respect to small variations in the function y(x) gives

(cid:6)

δE
δy(x) η(x) dx = 0.

(D.4)

Because this must hold for an arbitrary choice of η(x), it follows that the functional
derivative must vanish. To see this, imagine choosing a perturbation η(x) that is zero

everywhere except in the neighbourhood of a point(cid:1)x, in which case the functional
derivative must be zero at x = (cid:1)x. However, because this must be true for every
choice of(cid:1)x, the functional derivative must vanish for all values of x.

Consider a functional that is deﬁned by an integral over a function G(y, y

(cid:1)

that depends on both y(x) and its derivative y
dence on x

F [y] =

G (y(x), y

(cid:1)(x) as well as having a direct depen-
(cid:1)(x), x) dx

(D.5)

(cid:6)

(cid:6) (cid:12)

(cid:13)

where the value of y(x) is assumed to be ﬁxed at the boundary of the region of
integration (which might be at inﬁnity). If we now consider variations in the function
y(x), we obtain

parts and make use of the fact that η(x) must vanish at the boundary of the integral
(because y(x) is ﬁxed at the boundary). This gives

y(x) − d2y

dx2 = 0.

(D.8)

(D.9)

(D.10)

This second order differential equation can be solved for y(x) by making use of the
boundary conditions on y(x).

Often, we consider functionals deﬁned by integrals whose integrands take the
form G(y, x) and that do not depend on the derivatives of y(x). In this case, station-
arity simply requires that ∂G/∂y(x) = 0 for all values of x.

If we are optimizing a functional with respect to a probability distribution, then
we need to maintain the normalization constraint on the probabilities. This is often
most conveniently done using a Lagrange multiplier, which then allows an uncon-
strained optimization to be performed.

The extension of the above results to a multidimensional variable x is straight-
forward. For a more comprehensive discussion of the calculus of variations, see
Sagan (1969).

Appendix E

Appendix E. Lagrange Multipliers

Lagrange multipliers, also sometimes called undetermined multipliers, are used to
ﬁnd the stationary points of a function of several variables subject to one or more
constraints.

Consider the problem of ﬁnding the maximum of a function f(x1, x2) subject to

a constraint relating x1 and x2, which we write in the form

g(x1, x2) = 0.

(E.1)

One approach would be to solve the constraint equation (E.1) and thus express x2 as
a function of x1 in the form x2 = h(x1). This can then be substituted into f(x1, x2)
to give a function of x1 alone of the form f(x1, h(x1)). The maximum with respect
to x1 could then be found by differentiation in the usual way, to give the stationary
value x(cid:3)

1, with the corresponding value of x2 given by x(cid:3)

One problem with this approach is that it may be difﬁcult to ﬁnd an analytic
solution of the constraint equation that allows x2 to be expressed as an explicit func-
tion of x1. Also, this approach treats x1 and x2 differently and so spoils the natural
symmetry between these variables.

2 = h(x(cid:3)

1).

A more elegant, and often simpler, approach is based on the introduction of a
parameter λ called a Lagrange multiplier. We shall motivate this technique from
a geometrical perspective. Consider a D-dimensional variable x with components
x1, . . . , xD. The constraint equation g(x) = 0 then represents a (D−1)-dimensional
surface in x-space as indicated in Figure E.1.
We ﬁrst note that at any point on the constraint surface the gradient ∇g(x) of
the constraint function will be orthogonal to the surface. To see this, consider a point
x that lies on the constraint surface, and consider a nearby point x +  that also lies
on the surface. If we make a Taylor expansion around x, we have

g(x + ) (cid:8) g(x) + T∇g(x).

(E.2)

Because both x and x+  lie on the constraint surface, we have g(x) = g(x+ ) and
hence T∇g(x) (cid:8) 0. In the limit (cid:11)(cid:11) → 0 we have T∇g(x) = 0, and because  is

be solved by optimizing the Lagrangian function

Such a point must have the property that the vector ∇f(x) is also orthogonal to the
constraint surface, as illustrated in Figure E.1, because otherwise we could increase
the value of f(x) by moving a short distance along the constraint surface. Thus ∇f
and ∇g are parallel (or anti-parallel) vectors, and so there must exist a parameter λ
such that
where λ (cid:6)= 0 is known as a Lagrange multiplier. Note that λ can have either sign.
At this point, it is convenient to introduce the Lagrangian function deﬁned by

∇f + λ∇g = 0

(E.3)

L(x, λ) ≡ f(x) + λg(x).

(E.4)
The constrained stationarity condition (E.3) is obtained by setting ∇xL = 0. Fur-
thermore, the condition ∂L/∂λ = 0 leads to the constraint equation g(x) = 0.

Thus to ﬁnd the maximum of a function f(x) subject to the constraint g(x) = 0,
we deﬁne the Lagrangian function given by (E.4) and we then ﬁnd the stationary
point of L(x, λ) with respect to both x and λ. For a D-dimensional vector x, this
gives D + 1 equations that determine both the stationary point x(cid:3) and the value of λ.
If we are only interested in x(cid:3), then we can eliminate λ from the stationarity equa-
tions without needing to ﬁnd its value (hence the term ‘undetermined multiplier’).
As a simple example, suppose we wish to ﬁnd the stationary point of the function
f(x1, x2) = 1 − x2
2 subject to the constraint g(x1, x2) = x1 + x2 − 1 = 0, as
illustrated in Figure E.2. The corresponding Lagrangian function is given by

The conditions for this Lagrangian to be stationary with respect to x1, x2, and λ give
the following coupled equations:

1 − x2
L(x, λ) = 1 − x2

1 − x2

2 + λ(x1 + x2 − 1).

−2x1 + λ = 0
−2x2 + λ = 0
x1 + x2 − 1 = 0.

Figure E.2 A simple example of the use of Lagrange multipli-
ers in which the aim is to maximize f (x1, x2) =

where g(x1, x2) = x1 + x2 − 1. The circles show
contours of the function f (x1, x2), and the diagonal
line shows the constraint surface g(x1, x2) = 0.

2), and

So far, we have considered the problem of maximizing a function subject to an
equality constraint of the form g(x) = 0. We now consider the problem of maxi-
mizing f(x) subject to an inequality constraint of the form g(x) (cid:2) 0, as illustrated
in Figure E.3.

There are now two kinds of solution possible, according to whether the con-
strained stationary point lies in the region where g(x) > 0, in which case the con-
straint is inactive, or whether it lies on the boundary g(x) = 0, in which case the
constraint is said to be active. In the former case, the function g(x) plays no role
and so the stationary condition is simply ∇f(x) = 0. This again corresponds to
a stationary point of the Lagrange function (E.4) but this time with λ = 0. The
latter case, where the solution lies on the boundary, is analogous to the equality con-
straint discussed previously and corresponds to a stationary point of the Lagrange
function (E.4) with λ (cid:6)= 0. Now, however, the sign of the Lagrange multiplier is
crucial, because the function f(x) will only be at a maximum if its gradient is ori-
ented away from the region g(x) > 0, as illustrated in Figure E.3. We therefore have
∇f(x) = −λ∇g(x) for some value of λ > 0.

For either of these two cases, the product λg(x) = 0. Thus the solution to the

to the inequality constraint

E. LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS

problem of maximizing f(x) subject to g(x) (cid:2) 0 is obtained by optimizing the
Lagrange function (E.4) with respect to x and λ subject to the conditions

g(x) (cid:2) 0
λ (cid:2) 0
λg(x) = 0

(E.9)
(E.10)
(E.11)

These are known as the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions (Karush, 1939; Kuhn
and Tucker, 1951).
Note that if we wish to minimize (rather than maximize) the function f(x) sub-
ject to an inequality constraint g(x) (cid:2) 0, then we minimize the Lagrangian function
L(x, λ) = f(x) − λg(x) with respect to x, again subject to λ (cid:2) 0.

Finally, it is straightforward to extend the technique of Lagrange multipliers to
the case of multiple equality and inequality constraints. Suppose we wish to maxi-
mize f(x) subject to gj(x) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , J, and hk(x) (cid:2) 0 for k = 1, . . . , K.
We then introduce Lagrange multipliers {λj} and {µk}, and then optimize the La-
grangian function given by

J(cid:2)

K(cid:2)

L(x,{λj},{µk}) = f(x) +

λjgj(x) +

µkhk(x)

(E.12)

Appendix D

subject to µk (cid:2) 0 and µkhk(x) = 0 for k = 1, . . . , K. Extensions to constrained
functional derivatives are similarly straightforward. For a more detailed discussion
of the technique of Lagrange multipliers, see Nocedal and Wright (1999).
